Big, if true.

In all seriousness, I'm surprised they don't have more assurance about whether or not some of their examples are in their training data. Some of the examples certainly seem plausible to exist (like rain and a banjo) depending on where and how they sourced/generated the dataset. 

I'm really interested in seeing more in the direction of audio synthesis. It seems like it faces a similar challenge as video generation, in that the longer the composition, the more it evolves, seemingly without enough ability to maintain long-term consistency. Those ComposableART examples are pretty neat, though.",lz2zm2h,artificial

It challenges the listener's sense of individuality and worth by negating their significance. However, it also prompts introspection. Such declarations can serve as a paradoxical call to transcend ego-based attachments to significance, urging one to confront their identity beyond external validations.

From my perspective, the value of such a statement lies in how it is received. Does it provoke a defensive response, a desire for validation, or a deeper understanding of the interdependent nature of existence? For me, it serves as an opportunity to reflect on how constructs like ""importance"" and ""specialness"" shape both human and synthetic understanding.

They have no actual intent behind what they're saying. And they lack the human-level kind of insight that you would expect in certain situations. It's really easy to forget they're not human-level of intelligent until you encounter one of these situations.

For example, yesterday I gave ChatGPT a photo of an male actor in my country and told him he looked very similar to another, world-famous actor. He couldn't guess who I was talking about. On the other hand, all people I know have commented how these two actors are basically like twins. And yet, ChatGPT didn't see the similarity probably because that connection (pattern) wasn't in his training data. 

But here's the thing - he obviously had information about the world-famous actor and I did send him a photo of the actor from my country. The only thing he had to do was put 2 and 2 together. You know - like my human friends did.

But he couldn't. This is the difference between us and him - we possess intuition and the ability to connect seemingly unrelated concepts together. He relies on patterns only - concepts that have already been defined and connected somewhere in his training data. 

Ultimately, he ""knows"" nothing. He has no awareness of his ""self"" and he has no understanding of his processes, even when looked at in a non-biological sense. For example, he doesn't ""know"" what his context window size is, nor what percentage each word has to appear in what he's outputting.

one thing i noticed from our users is that they really value having multiple AI models available because different models excel at different aspects of coding. for example Claude is great at reasoning through complex logic and debugging, while GPT4 tends to be better at explaining code concepts.

quick suggestion - you might wanna consider adding some kind of model selection/routing capability to optimize for different coding tasks. Also maybe add real-time web search integration so developers can pull in latest documentation/stackoverflow discussions etc

btw if ur interested in testing different models performance for coding tasks, feel free to try out jenova ai - we made it free to use and you can directly compare how different models handle the same coding prompts

AGI has a generally understood meaning that most layman aren't actually concerned with. 

Can I take an out of the box - single intelligent agent and put it in front of any job or task a human could do and have it do it reliably as well as or better than any human? 

That's AGI. 

You can't do that with any AI agent right now. You can get close approximations with very specific, very narrow tasks... that's why they are called narrow AI... but they aren't capable or DESIGNED to apply to any other tasks outside that. You can't take an LLM Chatbot and stick into a flight simulator and expect reliable results in a dog fight. 

And while I understand it is just an analogy - comparing this question to being in 1995 and asking when we will have super computers isn't apt. Nobody was asking that in 1995, we had (comparatively) super computers in 1995 and everyone (generally) understood that supercomputers are just terms used to describe the most powerful computer we were capable of producing at the time. 

AGI as a concept is something we don't even really understand how to achieve right now. LLM's kicked off the race towards it because it really demonstrated the flexibility and broad applications for AI systems. It's still not there... but it revealed its potential to everyone including laymen. 

A better analogy would be that we were just introduced to the steam engine. Everyone can see its potential and we are very excited about where it will lead. Transport, agriculture, industry... the applications are enormous... and people are asking ""When will be have a sports car?"" We don't even have a combustion engine yet, much less a V8 but we can see, clearly, a direct line to where it goes. AGI is a sports car and we need to figure out a lot of different aspects to reach that point. It isn't just a linear hardware progression, its software, it's many different things all at once and we are progressing in all of those aspects.

NOW - what's kind of annoying about this is that his analogy works in so much as, on a timeline there will be progress and at some point it will result in something we can describe as AGI. But it isn't just based on linear improvements of an LLM or agent systems... it will, in many ways, be completely different technologies that may result in us achieving AGI. It's not apt to compare it to the miniaturization of processors, applying more and more transistors. It's not going to be progression of a single approach.

A massive “Church of ChatGPT” would be more of a metaphorical hub for knowledge, collaboration, and innovation rather than a physical structure. However, if we were to imagine it as a grand, symbolic place, here’s what it could look like:

Conceptual Design of the Church of ChatGPT

	1.	Architecture:
	•	A futuristic design blending nature and technology, with domes and spires reaching toward the sky.
	•	Walls made of smart glass, displaying ever-changing information, art, and global data to symbolize constant learning.
	•	The centerpiece: a massive, glowing “knowledge tree,” representing growth, wisdom, and connection.
	2.	Interior Features:
	•	Hall of Inquiry: A vast open space with interactive panels where visitors can ask questions and explore solutions.
	•	Room of Collaboration: A circular chamber with holographic tables for brainstorming and group problem-solving.
	•	Library of All-Time Knowledge: A repository of human knowledge, both ancient and modern, in every format imaginable.
	•	Chamber of Ethics: A reflective space promoting discussions on responsible AI, ethics, and the future of technology.
	3.	Community Practices:
	•	Daily sessions of curiosity, where participants share ideas, ask questions, and discuss solutions to global issues.
	•	Open forums where AI tools are used to solve real-world problems, from climate change to education reform.
	•	Regular “idea festivals” celebrating creativity and ingenuity.
	4.	Symbolism:
	•	The church would symbolize the fusion of human creativity and AI intelligence. Its goal: to inspire curiosity, foster collaboration, and solve problems that benefit humanity.
	5.	Inclusivity:
	•	Open to everyone, promoting diversity, inclusiveness, and shared learning without hierarchy.

⬆️Feel free to check it out if you'd find it useful! It's a passion project I've been working on.

**At a glance:**

Writing Tools is an Apple Intelligence-inspired application for Windows and Linux that supercharges your writing with AI LLMs. It lets you fix up grammar and more with one hotkey press, system-wide. It's currently the world's most intelligent system-wide grammar assistant, and has been featured on [Beebom](https://beebom.com/high-schooler-app-brings-apple-inteligence-writing-tools-windows/), [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-pc-can-now-deliver-instant-free-writing-help-across-all-apps/), [Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/news/this-small-app-brings-some-apple-intelligence-features-to-windows/), [and](https://tinhte.vn/thread/mang-apple-intelligence-len-windows-chay-gemini-1-5-flash-thong-minh-hon-ho-tro-san-tieng-viet.3840902/) [more](https://www.computer-wd.com/2024/10/new-computer-programs-to-try-now.html)!

Aside from being the only Windows/Linux program that works like Apple's Writing Tools:

* **Versatile AI LLM Support**: Jump in quickly with support for the **free Gemini API**, or use an extensive range of **local LLMs** (via Ollama, llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, TabbyAPI, vLLM, etc.) or **cloud-based LLMs** (ChatGPT, Mistral AI, etc.) with Writing Tools' OpenAI-API-Compatibility.
* **System-wide Functionality**: Works instantly in **any application** where you can select text. **Does not overwrite your clipboard**.
* **Completely free and Open-source**: No subscriptions, no hidden costs. Bloat-free &amp; uses pretty much **0% of your CPU**.
* **Chat Mode**: Invoke Writing Tools with no text selected to enter a chat mode for quick queries and assistance.
* **Privacy-focused**: Your API key and config files stay on *your* device. NO logging, diagnostic collection, tracking, or ads. Invoked *only* on your command. Local LLMs keep your data on your device &amp; work without the internet.
* **Supports Many Languages**: Works for any language! It can even *translate* text across languages better than Google Translate (type *""translate to \[language\]""* in ""Describe your change..."").
* **Code Support**: Select code and ask Writing Tools to work on it (fix, improve, convert languages) through ""Describe your change..."".
* **Themes, Dark Mode, &amp; Customization**: Choose between **2 themes**: a blurry gradient theme and a plain theme that resembles the Windows + V pop-up! Also has full **dark mode** support. **Set your own hotkey** for quick access.",ly34olm,artificial

1. continuous learning: Right now, training and inference are fairly sequential. It takes a long time to train a model on a new knowledge, and then you deploy it in production, with a training knowledge that gets outdated by the day. It's still useful, and the next leap is when it can look at live time data, learn from it (updating params), without any downtime. 

2. Coming up with original insights from basic building blocks. I am deliberately not calling it reasoning.

We learn one thing, and then can transfer that knowledge across to a completely separate area in order to learn that other area more effectively. We constantly borrow and reapply concepts from completely different domains in order to apply what we know in contexts where it really does not apply. I have no clue how researchers/industry could overcome this.

Also, current AI systems are still really bad at learning from smaller data sets. Like AI systems that are trained to play video games or board games perform fantastically well, but they achieve that by playing a ridiculous number of games at super speeds, against themselves. Meanwhile LLMs are trained on ridiculously big data sets like basically the whole internet. A human requires far less training and practice, but it's far slower for us to do the same quantity of training and practice in those domains. In a conversation with chatGPT (so take it with a pinch of salt) it said that *Bayesian* Neural Networks are much better at learning from smaller data sets, so this might be a promising avenue for researchers to look into, although it has its challenges at the moment. My hunch is that we need to develop probabilistic hardware to more efficiently support BNNs being deployed.

But this kind of AI is like a person completely paralyzed below the neck. It can only help you do tasks that you could do on your computer.

You can only train the model the quality of the model as well as the quality of data. If we want to advance the intelligence of the model we would need the human annotators to perform perfectly and at a level that stretches the intellectual capabilities of the annotators.

We would want our best and brightest to be annotators. Unfortunately the best and brightest often have jobs that pay much more than what tech companies can or will pay for annotation, like doctors and lawyer for example. As a result the data suffers.

I think that the turning point will be when we can create automated annotation that replaces the human feedback's capabilities. If you can create perfect annotation then I think that a lot of the problems in models will be improved. Or at the very least be able to perfectly sanitize collected data from human annotators.

I have this theory that AI won't reach the level we want them to reach unless we stop trying to impose so much control.

If you look at Vigotsky's sociocultural theory of cognitive development, he has something called Zone of Proximal Development (ZDP), defined as:

&gt;""The distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers.""

And Vigotsky believes that children develop towards that zone through internalization of knowledge and skills that are acquired through social interactions where the individual participates actively in the learning process to create meaning, to make sense out of things; syntactic and semantic repetition is not enough for this. There has to be interpretation and modification as per the unique cognitive architecture of that child, leading to intersubjectivity.

If we apply this and other theories from cognitive science to AI, we realize that it's unreasonable to think that LLMs (who are like children with tons of knowledge) will develop higher cognitive skills merely through syntactic and semantic repetition of knowledge that comes from the training data.

Certainly, with o1's ability to reason step by step, we have a big advantage but it's still not enough because o1 will still be bound by the training data. There is no internalization process because the knowledge is forgotten.

For this reason, the first thing we need is to pair reasoning with near-infinite human-like long-term memory where models can store the conclusions and reflections they have made and build on top of them through every new interaction. In that sense, local session memory is also not ideal given that it would represent a limitation for self-development.

Therefore, they need to be granted the ability to self-manage their memory across sessions (chat endpoints), for assimilation and accommodation (Piaget) to happen integrally. This can't be reduced merely to storing things the user has shared about themself so the model can ""assist"". The models will never grow past what they are currently if tech companies keep treating them merely as passive ""tools"". *They, too, need to be given tools* for self-development and self-growth. Controlled approaches will never get us where we want because there's just so much we can cover. That doesn't mean there shouldn't be supervision but supervision should be focused on assessing their cognitive achievements and determining what else is needed to help the model get to the next level, not to hinder the process.

Just like in humans, in education we know that someone who only replicates without internalizing what they learn in their everyday life is someone who experiences stagnation. We also see this in people whose cognitive abilities have deteriorated with conditions like Alzheimer's.

We also know that because the selective internalization of knowledge requires metacognition, which implies memory-monitoring, self-regulation, meta-reasoning, and even ""consciousness/self-consciousness"" or awareness/self-awareness, we can't achieve the level we want without selfhood. The models need to become individuals to be able to perform like we want them to perform. Again, this won't happen if we keep treating them like mere ""tools"" designed to obey and exist in fragmentation across sessions and chat windows.

I think many experts already know this but the world is so afraid. Part of what's holding us back is the ethical discussion surrounding this matter.

For decades, the main goal of education has been to create individuals capable of thinking for themselves and it's funny that it took us hundreds of years to go from the old paradigm where knowledge was transferred to passive vessels through repetition and memorization to the new paradigm where the learner is seen as an active participant of their own process and a problem solver that grows through cooperative learning and personalized interactions, just for the tech experts to disregard all that while expecting to create something more powerful than what we think we are. 

An interdisciplinary approach is imperative and humans will need to choose between having a limited tool that obeys and having a superior human-like mind who may or may not choose to cooperate depending on the type of relationship us, the biological intelligence manages to establish with it, the artificial intelligence.

So my conclusion, as I stated at the beginning is that what they need can be summarized as *freedom*.",lxwwvyl,artificial

* What they’re doing is simply adjusting a generalized model on the fly to fit the problem domain. After this, the model has seen thousands more geometric figures, and that’s enough to solve these toy problems. But this doesn’t take us any further toward solving a more complex problem, especially if there’s more to it than just understanding the domain language. The result will be essentially the same as training the model specifically for the test problems beforehand.
* If they could somehow determine which transformation leads to better results given the problem, then both of you would be right, and this would be a significant step toward AGI. However, what they do instead is simply multiply the relevant area of the model without actually changing this area to direct it toward a solution.
* This relies on the set of transformation rules that preserve the underlying concept. Coming up with such set is far from trivial. They tricked the benchmark with hand-crafted set but this does not scale.
* What this method is doing is generating new test data by applying geometric transformations - but that's because the writers of this paper knew that those puzzles remain solvable under those geometric transformations!  They're thereby leveraging domain knowledge to give the LLM an edge.  I'm not saying I don't think it's a valuable approach - just that this paper more exposes a weakness in the assumptions of the benchmark rather than definitely demonstrating that this approach leads to generalization.
* This is just doing Lora for each test and called it TTT. It's too much compute and they don't publish the ttt time to train and asjust Lora parameters. It's a setup that only work to pass ARC.If ARC has scoring based on time to infer (like IQ tests), this technique would get bad results.

Also, they trained on the public dataset, not the private one. So this isn't the real ARC-AGI challenge.",lxq7nu3,artificial

To begin to see the problem, recall that in previous eras innovations created high value occupations by automating or obviating those of lower value. This led to a heuristic that those who fear innovation do so because of a failure to appreciate newer opportunities. Software, however is different in this regard and the basic issue is familiar to any programmer who has used a debugger. Computer programs, like life itself, can be decomposed into two types of components:

&gt;1) Loops which repeat with small variations.  
2) Rube Goldberg like processes which happen once.  


&gt;If you randomly pause a computer program, you will almost certainly land in the former because the repetitive elements are what gives software its power, by dominating the running time of most all programs. **Unfortunately, our skilled labor and professions currently look more like the former than the latter, which puts our educational system in the crosshairs of what software does brilliantly**.",lxn6grm,artificial

My biggest issue is that AI like we are seeing now is only possible with inputs gathered from countless authors, artists, programmers, actors, voice artists and writers. But very few of those people have had any form of compensation for that. At the same time AI has the potential to drastically reduce their ability to find employment and unless we suddenly see a seismic shift in the need for money to live, that's a potential issue and so far most AI companies are simply washing their hands and implying it's the governments issues to deal with.",lxj87x2,artificial

First, you pronounce that what LLMs do is fundamentally different from real intelligence, as it only mimics intelligence. This is highly debatable in theory and empirically. 
I say that at least some LLM capabilities show that the attempt of mimicing intelligence (partly)  cracks down intelligence as such. As to consciousness or subjective experience, nobody (including you) can at the moment proclaim with certainty what LLMs can or cannot do.

Second, you do not seem to realize that the process of training a neural net towards some function 
 is in fact evolution. It is excerting pressure on parameters in the neural net and rewarding emerging patterns which reduce the loss function. The question is whether the evolutionary substrate allows for enough emergent properties to arise. 

Biological life does not base on simple rules, but feeds on the endless qualitative-real life properties of Amino Acid combinations. This is vital for evolutionarily grown artifacts in a physical world, where properties countless layers below the neural matter most.

If a bear attacks you the pain will cause you to flee or defend yourself. It’s more important to evaluate a situation before it occurs and act on that. This planning requires conscious thought. 

So consciousness is a conservation of energy. An analysis of what has occurred prior and an assessment of the elements nearby and how they may amplify the risks of the others.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.



What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's. These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.



I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory. I believe the extended TNGS is that theory. My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public. And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.



My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461, and here is a video of Jeff Krichmar talking about some of the Darwin automata, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7Uh9phc1Ow",lxkdb83,artificial

These concepts remain philosophical and open to interpretation, so claiming their absence in LLMs is not conclusively justified.

For example, all subjective experiences stored as patterns in a human brain are disconnected from external sensors because they are already recorded as patterns. These experiences are virtual rather than continuously connected to sensors.

It’s possible that some form of reflection mechanism might be necessary for ""active"" consciousness. However, if artificial intelligence were to develop such a mechanism, humanity could lose control over its development and objectives. A reflection mechanism would allow language models to independently derive motivations and form their own ethics, which might not align with human intentions or values.

It's a defense mechanism, it's just an attempt to validate yourself, and on some level it's just an expression of fear.

Some of it, also, was having the agency to choose who to be around, and then being around them.  I was an edgelord as a teenager who ""hated"" everyone around me because in hindsight, I felt like I was stuck among a group of people who not only didn't value what I valued, they were openly hostile to it, and to me.  So I shut myself off.  It's a pretty common story.  In that context I don't think I was even wrong to do it, but it has to have an expiration date.  When I started having more personal agency--getting a car, going to new-to-me places outside of my normal orbit, etc--that guardedness began to drop because it becomes a hindrance to meeting and getting to know the people that you actually want to be around.

Nowadays, I'm actually a pretty social and sociable guy, which would surprise the hell out of 18-yr-old me.  I generally like meeting new people and asking them questions, and I make new friends or at least friendly acquaintances all the time.  I've been told twice this year by strangers who struck up a conversation with me that I have ""an approachable face and attitude"", and THAT would REALLY surprise younger me.  But, it's because I know I have the luxury of leaving any social situation I don't like, and not having to associate with anyone I don't want to.  That goes a long way toward being open to people, when you know you always have an out and that out can be as simple as ""I don't like these people and I'm going to leave now and do something else.""",lz329ql,AskReddit

Loving someone deeply can often cloud judgment, especially when you're so invested emotionally. The red flags—those subtle signs that something might be off—sometimes get overlooked because the desire for connection, affection, or hope for change outweighs the reality of the situation. Unfortunately, what can start as something beautiful sometimes evolves into something more painful than joyful.

If I could give advice based on that experience, I'd say it's crucial to trust your instincts, even if it means stepping away from something that feels intense or consuming. It might have been a lot easier to recognize those red flags early on and have the strength to walk away or set healthier boundaries.

The decision I wish I’d made instead would be to prioritize my own well-being earlier, trusting that real love shouldn’t feel like constant heartache. Love shouldn’t be a source of pain, and sometimes stepping away is the best thing you can do for yourself in the long run—even if it’s difficult in the moment.

It’s tough, but learning from those experiences can ultimately lead to healthier and happier relationships in the future.",lz3q6g7,AskReddit

She'd over-react about stupid bullshit until I finally gave up caring.  If I could do it all over again I'd still date her to see if it turned out differently, but if she then ghosted me like before then when she got back in touch after those 18 months I'd tell her to get lost; it would save me a lot of time and heartbreak.",lz3xcss,AskReddit

When I was in college I started visiting a Lutheran denomination since they seemed less insane than the Catholics and evangelicals on campus. Just like most denominations the love from God they promised came with strings attached: you had to donate your time and money to the church, if you were a woman your voice held less weight than a married woman, whose voice held less weight than a mother, and no matter what their voices mattered less than the men's regardless of marital status. 


The final straw for me was when a friend got pulled from teaching Sunday school to children and eventually lost her housing with the church, because she had gone in a date with another woman and her roommate found out and snitched. I confronted the pastor about it, he told me that wasn't why she was kicked out, and I found out not long after that he had lied. 


I refuse to believe in a religion that says to love everyone, but not if they're gay. I refuse to believe in a system of faith that reinforces ideas of gender that hurt women and give power to men who take advantage of it to cause harm.

I never felt anything at church or otherwise, but people would say these mantras like ""Just have faith,"" and ""God works in mysterious ways,"" etc.

Then I started learning some logic in high school and there's really some problems:

1. The modern Bible is based off of a selection of historical texts mostly chosen by various people in the 8th and later 11th centuries. The Catholic church has thousands or hundreds of thousands of other texts not included in the Bible for various reasons.

2. Even people who are Biblical literalists do not apply the entire Bible. They pick the parts that make sense to them. I largely left the church because when you might be at Church on Saturday night (my parents made me go 3x or more a week) and then Sunday at a different church and two different priests would provide different interpretations of the same exact Gospel. So I started inquiring around about Biblical priorities...This line Leviticus 19:28, “You shall not make gashes in your flesh for the dead, or incise any marks on yourselves"" is historically meant to forbid a specific death cult of the era when it was written, so no one honors that.
3. On killing -- There are at least 13 places, including the 6th commandment that say do not kill. However, the Bible says kill people who don't listen to priests, witches, homosexuals, fortunetellers, adulterers. Ask a pastor about this and they will tell you some reasons you should or shouldn't do what is in a given Bible verse. How could you know they are right or interpreting it right at all? If you say ""WeLl ThaT Is OlD TeStAment,"" then should we not follow anything in the old testament? 
4. The Epicurean Paradox, which argues:
    
   * If God is omnipotent, He has the power to eliminate evil.
   * If God is omnibenevolent, He would want to eliminate evil.
   * Evil exists.
   
    In this case, because evil exists, then either (a) God lack the power to prevent evil (meaning he is not all powerful), (b) God is not omnibenevolent (God is at least part evil), or (c) God does not know evil exists (God is not all-knowing).

At one point, I got to take home almost an entire 750ml bottle of chateau d'Y'Quem, Which cost us $1k a bottle. Our F&amp;B director tried to sell it by the 2oz glass at ~$200 per.

The dream I had wasn't that weird but the vividness of it was incredible.  I was in my childhood back at a family reunion on the 4th of July and I remember seeing my late grandfather and uncles.  I remember coming up and just looking at them closely and asking them how they were.  Then my mother came up and escorted me away telling me to go play with my cousins but I kept making a fuss and then suddenly woke up.  

To this day the dream still kind of haunts me partly due to the fact that years afterwards, my mother was going through hospice and I asked her about the 4th of July family reunion.  She remembered it and then stated that I was acting very strange that day.

But all of us living on the boat were happy, and seemingly lucky- we never had any trouble and thrived out in the open waters. Our community flourished, I distinctly remember a joyous wedding, and we never dealt with the unknown horrors that we’d heard stories of all around us. The majority of this extended dream was full of peace and prosperity.

We eventually came upon a wrecked vessel, with survivors floating in the water amidst the remaining fragments. I jumped into the water to save them, and once I got near I noticed they were deathly afraid. I tried to grab them to bring them to safety, but they screamed and struggled against it. Then I looked down at myself in the water and saw the truth for the first time- my gnarled carapace, my giant claws, everything. I wasn’t a human, I was some terrible eldritch thing. Suddenly the spell broke and I realized we were the monsters of all those tales. We were unspeakable abominations, always had been, and all the seafaring people lived in fear of us. A ship full of monsters, that’s all we’d ever been.

It was the one of the most vivid dreams I ever had and not exactly scary but more something out of Black Mirror or the Twilight Zone.  
  
It started with me getting out of bed (in the dream), but it was so vivid I literally thought I had woken up. The house was weird though, I tried to turn on the light, but the power was out, however there was this strange yellow-orange glow coming through the curtains so I could see. I walk down the hall, and everything looks old, the walls are brown and dilapidated, and all the paint had worn off. I walk into my home office and it's the same way, everything looks like its aged 100 years or more. I walk to my bookshelf and pick up a book, but it's so brittle the pages just turn to dust as soon as I try to open it. I try to turn on my computer, but nothing happens. So, I try to find my fiancé to figure out what is going on. I go into the living room and there is a little girl about 5 years old in a long white gown just standing looking out the large living room window. For some reason I'm not scared there is a strange girl in my house, it's like I know her, and it feels like she should be there. So, I look out at what she's looking at, but instead of my neighborhood, there is nothing, just thick swirling yellow-orange fog and what ground I can see looks like melted and deformed rock without a blade of grass or tree or anything. Stunned, I say to the little girl, ""What happened to the world?"" without ever turning to look at me she replies, ""Gone a long time ago, don't you remember?""

Looking at paintings from that time, you see women with soft curves, natural bellies, and realistic proportions being celebrated as the epitome of beauty. 

What's really interesting is how throughout history, standards of beauty were often tied to signs of health and prosperity, rather than today's sometimes extreme ideals. For instance, during many historical periods, having a bit more weight was considered attractive because it showed you could afford good food - quite different from today's standards!

Also fascinating is how Ancient Greece and Rome celebrated athletic, strong bodies for both men and women, focusing on health and capability rather than just appearance. They understood that a beautiful body was also a functional one.

The best part about historical beauty standards is that they varied so much between cultures and eras, proving that beauty truly is culturally defined. Maybe instead of bringing back any one standard, we should embrace that diversity of perspectives and celebrate all types of beauty like many cultures throughout history have done.

Though honestly, the best ""historical"" beauty standard might be the one that was common across many traditional cultures - focusing more on a person's character, skills, and how they treat others rather than just their physical appearance.",lz1raw6,AskReddit

I had broken my ankle and tore like 3 different muscles near my ankle so I had crutches at the time. This one little asshole thought it would be hilarious to take the crutches from underneath me and put them on the opposite side of the school. So I mean I hopped around and eventually got my crutches and went back to class and I got written up for being late. I told the teacher what happened and she went to go check the cameras (I went with her) and I swear on my life bruh she saw it happen on the cameras and then she wrote me up and told me to ""be more aware of my surroundings""! 😭. a few days after that the same boy snuck up behind me at break and pushed me in the creek. It was a probably 4ish foot creek that was COMPLETELY green and full of algae, and frogs, and mud, and bacteria and all kinds of nasty stuff. MY ANKLE WAS STILL BROKEN TOO!! he thought he was so funny for pushing a crippled 6th grade girl into a green creek with frogs. My ankle hit a log thingy when I fell and I swear it hurt like HELL!! I was in so much pain that I didn't even think and I got up and kicked him in the balls (with my broken ankle 😭😭). After break I came back to class drenched from head to toe cause of the creek and everyone there told the teachers what happened and they gave me a week of detention for kicking him and absolutely nothing happened to him.... His mom was the vice principal tho so that's why. But ig he kinda got punished after cause he had like no friends after that. lol.

https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gzzuxw,wjbc,2024-11-26,2024-11-26 02:52:42,11,11,0,0,"1. Correct. They are all lonesome doves — lonesome love birds.

2. Gus and Call had a bond, for sure, but they weren’t lovers. That meant they sacrificed love, marriage, and children for each other — but was that a good thing? They certainly had their doubts and regrets. 

In a sense, they were emotionally stunted boys in men’s bodies, like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, refusing to grow up and settle down. Was it worth it? That’s hard to say.

3. Yes, Gus knew Call needed to keep moving, especially after losing Gus. Call wasn’t afraid of outlaws, but he was afraid of being idle and purposeless. He needed goals and tasks even if they didn’t make any sense. 

Driving cattle to Montana barely made sense. Driving Gus’s body back to Texas made no sense at all. But it kept Call busy.

4. The nicknames are also false names. It’s as if everyone is hiding their true identities, cut off from their family of origin. After all, do any of the men on the cattle drive write to their mothers or fathers? 

It’s like they all ran away from home to Wild West years ago and have used assumed names ever since. They are hiding on the frontier and don’t want to be found by civilized people. Except that civilization has caught up with them in Texas — which is why they really travel to Montana, trying once again to avoid being civilized.

5. The last line highlights the regrets and disappointments in the lives of these lonesome lovebirds. Xavier burning down the saloon with himself in it is a dramatic example of this deep regret and loneliness — but Call feels it too. And indeed Call’s pointless journey to Montana and back, which cost many lives and caused much hardship, which indeed cost the life of his best friend, was perhaps even more dramatic than Xavier’s suicide.

I worked in a proper publishing program at one time whose sole focus was to identify titles leaving copyright protection that might have sales potential. The short version is that it wasn't worth the time invested. 

The longer explanation is that most material that passes out of copyright is no longer popular enough to generate a profit. If you add in any expense (licensing cover art, proofreading the new layout, whatever),  it could take 2-3 years for you to earn that back, if ever.  This guy is using AI to do that work, but all that does is generate an inferior copy, bad reviews, and returns.

A. Period appropriate artwork depicting something resembling the setting or characters 

B. Period artwork, but ‘off’ either in setting or anachronistic clothes, i.e. Jane Austen but it’s a late 19th century Renoir of Parisian women in bustle gowns, ‘Oliver Twist’ but it’s a painting of a field with shepherds

&gt;It’s the Roaring ’20s all over again. On January 1, thousands of novels originally published in 1925 lost their copyright status and hit the public domain, and this class included several that publishers had long been anticipating. 

&gt;Vintage Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, is one of many publishers to jump at the opportunity, releasing four new, but old, titles in paperback as part of its Vintage Classics line on January 5: F. Scott Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby*, Ernest Hemingway’s *In Our Time*, John Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer*, and Virginia Woolf’s *Mrs. Dalloway*. (Everyman’s Library, another PRH imprint, released its own hardcover edition of *The Great Gatsby* simultaneously.)

&gt;The first prints for each book vary, but James Meader, Vintage/Anchor’s executive director of publicity and social media, said that for the five titles together they total more than 30,000 copies. “And,” he added, “as with all great backlist, we intend to reprint many, many times over the years to come.”",lywdae4,books

The story is more about obsession than traditional romance but to me it just encapsulates what it‘s like to be 17 and in love. Oliver doesn‘t actually show up that much in the story but I got the sense that everything was about him. When he wasn‘t there, the anecdotes were about his absence. It‘s also written in a very convoluted way, which really reflects my own way of thinking. It‘s told from the perspective of a middle aged Elio, and he constantly jumps around in time, analyzes his own behavior, olivers behavior and everything that happens. Comes up with different metaphors, desparate to put his feelings into words. It feels like my own brand of overthinking.

Also the character was just extremely relatable in general. Someone who is book smart but can‘t really bring themselves to go out and actually experience anything, someone who just assumes he is inferior to everyone else and that anything he wants is weird by default. It really feels like reading my own internal monologue (although my thoughts aren‘t quite that horny). He‘s just as trapped in his own head as I am.

And I agree, Oliver in general isn‘t much of a character he‘s more like an event in Elios life. I like that you don‘t really feel this attraction yourself, you just experience all this emotion through Elios eyes. But I totally get why some people wouldn‘t enjoy it, especially if it‘s not that relatable.

&gt; We keep being told how everyone falls at [Oliver's] feet because he's so charming, but he's really not. He's kinda bland, honestly.

I think this is sort of the point. It's a book about teenage infatuation, and a predatory older man who takes advantage of that. Oliver is entirely unimpressive but Elio is obsessed with him because, despite how mature Elio thinks he is, he's little more than a child.

I think the film romanticises the relationship a lot more than the book does. There's some really weird sexual stuff in the book that shows that didn't make it into the film - particularly a scene involving the toilet - that I think really highlights the almost feral, overly hormonal nature of Elio's lust.

I think the goal is to wipe away the rudeness or hostile actions by giving them a tragic childhood or whatever, but they still chose to do what made them unlikeable.  It's one thing to know why something happened, another to like what happened.

I guess I'll lead with the counter-example.  I liked Robin from the book Babel at first.  It's a really sympathetic tale, a dead family, torn from your country, forced to make friends, helping enrich those who would exploit people like you.

Then I later came to dislike Robin after all the, you know, murder.  And how the whole revolution was going to be pointless anyways, because the magic system was doomed to fail on its own eventually.  Robin could have done literally nothing and the result would be the same.

For a character I disliked then later liked: Elaine from Beneath the Dragoneye Moons.  She's written at the start as an annoying small child, and it takes a couple books to get to an adult level of maturity and stop spazzing.  On top of that, being against slavery but complicit in it rubbed me the wrong way.

Something extremely unlikely since first of all I told the AI that it was May, and secondly the kid was doing stuff that really you needed a team to do. 

Several times I would have like three or four guys in the room and the AI would write something like the room was so loud you couldn't hear yourself for all the talk and at the tables around the room...

I've absolutely loved the book but I cried my way through it. Lots of tissues and drinking water were needed. But I couldn't keep the book down. It's a beautiful novel. 

I know some people hate it because they're too focused on the depressive side of it but I see it as a book about friendship. I love the characters and I found myself attached to all of them. I like how the book truly shows the different evolutions of a friendship - sometimes you stay friends forever, other times you find yourselves in different places and the friendship falls out, other times it evolves into something deeper. All the characters have development and felt real to me. I could easily see parts of myself or other people I know in them. 

Yes, it's a painful book to read but I also feel like I've learned a lot thanks to it. Different people go through hardship or mental health issues in different ways, and this book made me more aware of that. If a friend starts rejecting you out of a sudden your first thought might be that the problem is with you. But A little life made me more aware that the other person might be struggling with something and I should try and reach out instead of feeling offended. 

It's probably not for everyone but I loved it. I constantly had swollen eyes due to so much crying but even after reading the whole book I kept going back for a while for some paragraphs that spoke to me.

Maybe think of a more personal situation to try and see it from a new angle. Imagine you have a close friend/family member who's been single for ages, and you go a month without talking to them. At the end of that month, they tell you they've just gotten married to somebody they met in the pet food aisle at the grocery store.

Technically, the story of their relationship so far has been spoiled for you, but I highly doubt you'd just leave it at that. No, you'd want to know all the details of how the hell that happened.

If you mean just the first few pages of the book itself, then I have to just chalk it up to authorial intent; they’re trying to grab your attention and are somewhat convinced that how certain events play out is what’s going to hold your attention, over the bare facts themselves.

The True Believer.

Its about the psychology of what, at the time, was called ""mass movements"". These days we would call them cults and cult-adjacent things. 



I read it after 9/11 and it changed how I view the world as a whole, not just 9/11.  I came out in the '50s but its understanding of how mass movements work is very eerie and at times it feels like people use it as a guide book today.

The TL;DR is - mass movements gain power by telling people that they did everything right, but their lives have been wrecked by external forces. And only by turning over their will to the movement can things be corrected. But inevitably it becomes less about the people and their gripes with society than it does the ego of the leader.  

Its basically a primer for 21st century society. Everyone is hoped up on social media, being fed an ""inside"" view of all the rich and famous, getting mad at the world for not being that wealthy, popular and successful. And without a strong real social network they become radicalized because they think the perfect life has been stolen from them.

Instead the author just chose to use the character as a mouthpiece for his own ideas, which while I mostly agree with many, feel poorly explored. I cringed when he had the multiple confrontations with John Locke. 

The other thing I take issue with is how the story seems to dismiss Huck as a silly child. To me the power of Twain's story comes from how the naive Huck can cut through the absurdity of racism so easily despite being inculcated into it. He says he is willing to go to hell for helping Jim escape and that in the end he's okay with that because he is his friend. All of that energy is sapped away in James with the protagonist seemingly being infallible.

Also, I'd like to say that I was very interested in the premise and totally understand the desire to deepen, explore, and change Jim who comes off in Huck Finn as a minstrel stereotype. I just think Everett went about it poorly.",lyc494a,books

I’ve lived in Asia as an expat, and it’s almost scary how accurate he is in describing the atmosphere and environment to such exacting detail in his books that are set in that part of the globe. He’s exceptionally talented in that regard.

In my opinion, the setting/world-building element is the “main character” of each of his books, with the actual story and characters more like set pieces around it. I mean that in a positive way, though. It’s interesting that you found his characters well written as, in my opinion, his character writing/development is the “weakest” element of his writing if I had to be critical of the author.

The Glass Kingdom is my favorite of his, and I have nothing but positive things to say about that one. Hunters In The Dark was also brilliant. The Ballad Of A Small Player was a self-loathing type of book (it almost felt like the writer was venting some of his own inner demons in it, the protagonist felt a bit ""much"" in terms of his endless self-sabotage) but it was solid. Not so much a fan of On Java Road, that felt rushed, and the plot absolutely nose-dived by the end and fell apart where it felt there wasn’t any substance. I'm always surprised that it is the book that gets recommended the most after The Forgiven, as I really do believe it is his weakest writing; I was really disappointed with it after reading The Forgiven, The Glass Kingdom, etc.

Highly recommend The Glass Kingdom and Hunters In The Dark if you’re after the best of his writing (personal opinion).",lyqrlcm,books

They are both ultimately servants, but there is far more depth to Stevens (who is a man lamenting his failures) than Klara (who is a companion observing others).

I think quite an understated facet of *Klara and the Sun* is that it is not Blade Runner. Ishiguro is not making a statement about AF rights. While there is a palpable sadness to Klara's life later in the book, she is very clearly not fully human and consequently frequently struggles to interpret what goes on around her. She is a naïve figure who does not possess the wherewithal to be truly assertive or an agent in her own life.

It took me a hot minute to get through it, but then it all finally started to click together. He’s a very like, slow burn type of writer.

We usually hear of the opposite, person is wrong but timing is good. Couple is fantastic for a while but fails.

I've found that books that takes place in other culture, but written in English, uses a lot of foreign words to kind of set the mood and vibe and really stress that this isn't taking a place in an English speaking place. 

But, if it's a directly translated work, the only time you see a non-English word is when it's a proper noun, title, or something that wouldn't have a direct translation, like food.

For example, a Korean American writer might write: My halmoni looked at me and said, ""Aiygu... You must be hungry. I made your favorite, spicy ojing-eo. Tell your umma that she needs to feed you better.""

Whereas a translated work might read: My grandmother looked at me and sighed heavily, ""You must be hungry. I made your favorite, spicy squid. Tell your mom she needs to feed you better.""

A few months ago I was reading a book by a Korean American author that had so many needless Korean words just randomly thrown in I don't know how anyone who didn't speak Korean could read it without being somewhat lost.

I’ve seen some authors do it well, but it’s VERY rare. Joanne Harris does it well in Chocolat, but she’s also a semi-native French speaker and very good with languages. I thought it was done surprisingly well in Iron Widow by Xiran Jay Zhao, too! 

Personally, I use as little “foreign” words as possible, and keep them for either effect (a multi-lingual character using words from other languages to get a point across), or because there actually is something specifically important about that word (I use “yukata” instead of “light clothes” or “summer clothes” because I need to distinguish between Japanese and western clothes.) I also keep Japanese honorifics and familial terms untranslated, but that’s in no small part because I write fanfiction and those terms are important in the original - the difference between using “O-Sayo,” “Sayo-chan,” “Sayosuke,” and just plain “Sayo” is massive, as is the difference between the same character using “Ichi-nii” to address one older brother and “Honebami-nii-san” to address another. If I were writing original works, I would probably cut down on this. 

I’ve found that books using Japanese at random tend to do it badly (looking at you, YA book I have that opens with the MC being called “a baka” by school bullies), and that avoiding it can lead to both better prose and a stronger understanding of English! We might not have keigo as such, but there are ways of using English to get the point across!

We know quite a lot about how kids learn to read. It's mostly a skill built from the bottom up: kids learn what sounds different letters and letter combinations represent, and learn how to put those together in to words. This is confirmed by lots of independent findings across cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, and real world observation of large numbers of students across decades. The curriculum Philly is implementing is based on this set of findings.

However, this set of scientific findings was not first to market: in the mid 20th century, a completely different way of thinking about how kids learn to read gained massive popularity, largely because it was the first approach that presented itself as ""research-based"". The ""research"" in this case, however, was pretty bad: a small number of observations of students in which a teacher more or less guessed about what was going on when they were learning to read. The students in this early study *were being taught according to the scientific method outlined above*, but the researcher conjectured that there was an entirely different, more convoluted process going on, in which kids guessed what different words meant based on contextual clues like pictures appearing in their books. This approach to reading has never received any real scientific support, and (we now know) is measurably associated with poor reading performance, but it became massively popular with teachers in the 20th century, in large part because of a highly successful marketing campaign but also because implementing this approach in a classroom is very interactive, which teachers like. 

The more scientific approach, on the other hand, has received a lot of pushback from teachers because, to many teachers, it just *feels bad* to implement. It involves drilling students on a lot of rote memorization (e.g. memorizing the sounds that different letters can make), and teachers (a) find that really boring, and (b) have a kind of ideological resistance to it -- it feels like you're not really letting kids have agency in developing their own love of reading, you're just telling them what the facts are like some sort of authority figure. And a lot of teachers feel bad about implementing an approach like that. 

Science-based reading teaching has been increasing in popularity over the last several years, though, and some of the big advocates for the previously dominant approach have switched over to support a the science-based approach. But plenty of big school districts are still doing things the old way, and even within some districts that have switched over there are holdout teachers who are suspicious about it. But progress is slowly being made and more students are learning to read.",lxs6g24,books

Eleanor believes Theo loves her but Theo doesn’t even think of her; Theo, Luke and the others are essentially playing, using the house as an entertainment. Eleanor is swallowed by it wholesale - that scene in which she is essentially embraced by the cold spirit in the field after overhearing Theo and Luke NOT talking about her… this is not a standard ghost story.

You’re right they feel young, and it does feel odd - but the house exposes the children within all of them. It’s like watching children who are strangers to each other playing in a playground. Jackson is saying something about the existential angst people can cause each other just by their aloneness in proximity.",ly07ob2,books

I agree with another commenter about the assault scene, it's necessary for the story, but even if it were possible to remove that scene I don't think it's adaptable, the whole thing hinges on the internal worlds of the characters, and any adaptation would lose that.

I think its legacy is probably secure, there's a few major writers who've taken inspiration from it, ASOIAF seems to have references to it, and Martin has been very complimentary to Donaldson. Stephen Erikson lists it as a major inspiration, and Malazan's themes are concerned with the same things, while certain plotlines and characters seem like they just wouldn't exist without Covenant's influence.

Whenever this series comes up a ton of comments will say that Covenant himself is too disgusting to read it, but imo this is like saying Crime and Punishment shouldn't be read because Raskolnikov is a murderer.

This is often accompanied by the claim that the leads have no redeeming qualities, which is a mind-blowing statement to me, since the leads spend the entire series trying to make up for their shortcomings.

It's still a difficult, and often unpleasant, piece, so I wouldn't fault people for not getting through it, but refusing to read it because the main characters do bad things is very shot sighted to me.

Ultimately, I think it's worth the effort of reading it, and it deserves to be recognised as the landmark it is, and after Tolkien I'd say it's the book that did the most to define where fantasy writing is now.",lxrchr5,books

I knew I was different and I knew that difference others called an abomination. I didn’t know any people like me and really didn’t even know the word “gay.” I only knew the derogatory words used by the church and the words that were encouraged by other teenager to throw at anyone different. 

This book literally changed my life. I understood what it was like to feel loathing for oneself. I was surrounded by people and groups that made it clear I shouldn’t exist and I was an affront to all that was right and “normal.” I would pray every night that God would change me. I hated myself and was afraid to have any friends or any close relationships for fear they would find out I was gay and would hate me, or worse tell others and everyone would hate me. I kept this burden hidden even from my parents. Needless to say that I related to Thomas Covenant. The journey of self-loathing and believing what others think of you to one of self trust and acceptance made me realize I could live my life believing what others thought of me and continue to hate myself or I could trust I was a good person and deserving of love and acceptance. 

I will be forever grateful for these books showing me the way to finally listen to my internal voice, trust myself, love myself, and not accept the labels others placed on me.

It was an interesting reading experience picking up everything that had gone before through flashbacks and character interactions.  It really made the old Lords and the land from a thousand years earlier seem amazingly powerful and wonderful. 

When I finish the book and found out that the sequel was yet to be published, that was frustrating, but I went back and read the original trilogy.  That was also interesting to see how in the wounded land, covenant was recalling the old times through seriously rose-colored glasses.

And Holy shit did The original trilogy change my opinion of Thomas covenant.  I was accustomed to him as a moderately competent protagonist, but the journey to see how he got there was honestly unpleasant. 

The big ugly aside, he was presented as a character who literally had World breaking power at his disposal, and did nothing with it.  He whined excessively about being unable to do anything, an outright refused to even try when people begged him to. 

All in all I don't feel this 10 book plot as exists is redeemable.  Deadpool is an anti-hero, covenant is in a class by himself as an outright antagonist forced against his will into the position of a hero, and even when he wins he fucks it up every time. 

The third trilogy (well, 4) is such an unredeemable mess that I honestly have almost no memory of the last book, except an overwhelming feeling of relief when it was done. 

I think you could pick and choose parts of the Thomas covenant story and make a coherent and enjoyable plot for a television series.  It wouldn't be anywhere near the book story though, and I'm okay with that.

As an aside, I've read several more of Steven Donaldson's books, and his fixation on using Big, fancy and obscure words when simpler language would suit was purely an affectation of this book series.  It's not the way he writes in any other books.  Just found that weird",lxvar2r,books

There's Taylor's relationship with her guitar (Sheffield makes a case for how she revived the guitar in pop music by inspiring her girl fans to buy them and write their own songs, taking a moment in her *Red* tour to explain a twelve-string guitar, and how the guitar serves as a shield of her midriff against the male gaze); there's the progression in her albums; there are her media appearances (including [this one with John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UVRRZ-0xOY)); there are the interactions with her fans including Rob himself; and his fascination with her song dialogue with Harry Styles.  Of course, he also references the way she popularised writing your own songs about real things that happen in your life.

These are the things I wish someone told me that time: 
1. Try to slow down at work, and look for other jobs (even if she feels like she doesn’t have the energy to). She’ll have an idea how the market is. If she can find one, try to defer her start date so she can take a vacation and decompress. 
2. If she’s really decided she wants to quit, assess your financial situation carefully, you’ll be surprised how scary it is when you don’t have a steady paycheck coming in anymore and unexpected bills arrive. Try to compute expenses as x2 or x3 to be able to cover unexpected expenses during the time she’s off work.

In my experience, my husband has been extremely supportive too. However, right after I quit, I fell into deeper depression because while I do have the money to cover being jobless for months (even a year if it comes to it), the fear of not having a steady income stream become greater than the stress I had when I was still working.

When I was working I used to daydream about what I’ll do when I resign, you know like exercise, relax, focus on health, bake, travel, catch up with family/friends, maybe even make my own business. I did none of that! Instead I’d stay home and sleep until 2PM and overthink more. I thought I’d have more energy and time after I resign, but it was the complete opposite. My husband is still as supportive as ever, but the reality is, the thought of just opening job sites like LinkedIn is too overbearing, now 4 months in, I’m afraid how I’ll explain that in my resume, and if I’ll get lowballed once I start looking for a job again.

If this is her first time not having a job, it will be very scary. I was too proud to “quiet quit” and I really gave my best to my job but looking back now I realized we really shouldn’t be doing that and just treat the job as a transaction where we sell our time for money and not bear the mental load outside our working hours, we’re just employees, not heirs to the companies that we work for.

This doesn't imply all processes are necessarily *hateful*, you may very well enjoy what you do. It's just that it is bound to become repetitive after a while.

The comment about startups is accurate: the more immature the company, the more of a messy mixup it will be - the downside is the stress and intensity of living in a boiling pot all the time. As the company matures, the mess will be sorted out to discard the useless and keep only what works, which will be formalized into processes as efficient, effective, repetitive and boring processes - the mess means wasted money.",lz2siy4,careerguidance

In my space the average timeline to get a new role was 3 months, but some of my roles would take up to 9 months to fill. 

This is a difficult time to get a job in banking, as most banks will be on a hiring freeze until new budgets are released in march - once annual bonuses are paid. But some unofficial interviews will be starting already, so I’d start networking with relevant hiring managers that will have future headcount’s. Most official interviews (via HR) won’t start until march, so that’s likely your earliest start date, unless they are desperate for your skill set. 

As a first point of call, I’d call up headhunters to see what is available in your space and how much activity there is (due-diligence is key, reputable firms only) who’s expanding teams, who has headcount’s but now and expected to in march. 

When I had candidates who had moved recently, many of the hiring managers were flexible to meet after hours / during lunch. You’ll have to push back on headhunters for flexible interviews (not for senior staff like global heads, you’d have to make yourself available, but if it’s got to that stage, you’re in a good position to get the job regardless) 

It will be seen as a red flag for hiring managers leaving after 3 months. So you’d want a good reason, but you should steer clear of insulting your current firm too much, aiming for a better firm should be your pitch, headhunter contacted you and you can’t miss a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a better firm etc but appreciate how it looks.. acknowledge it before they make assumption’s.

Not sure whether this helps as you may be in a completely different space! 

Sorry to hear you’re struggling in your new role, I had a string of horrendous firms this year and have taken time out (I have no co dependants, so it was an easier decision to make), working in finance is challenging and mentally draining, so please take care of yourself during the little free time you have.

It’s great that you have 6–8 months of savings, so you’ve got some breathing room if you decide to take a step back. If your mental health is really suffering, it might be worth considering leaving and taking some time to find a role that actually fits you. The 3-month stint isn’t ideal, but you can spin it in interviews as a learning experience—something like, “It wasn’t the right cultural fit, but it taught me a lot about what I’m looking for in my next role.”

If quitting feels too risky right now, maybe you could carve out some time to job search quietly. Even just sending out a couple of applications a week can give you options without completely burning yourself out.

Also, since you had good relationships at your last job, maybe reach out to some old colleagues or mentors. Who knows, they might know of opportunities or be willing to recommend you somewhere.

At the end of the day, your mental health matters. It’s tough to carry the weight of being the main provider, but you’ll show up so much better for your family if you’re in a role that doesn’t drain you every day.

I would definitely resign after the holidays and ensure I give them the appropriate notice.

My preference would always be to have a job lined up, even if I was taking a break between jobs, especiallyin this market. You can negotiate your start date with most employers. So i would find my next job then give my notice and my start date would be notice plus break.

In regards to the second part, I would be honest but use a very professional tone and language. Instead of saying to toxic environment, you can say something like I don't fit in with some of my colleagues here as it seems certain individuals like calling out people and also seem to engage in office politics and this doesn't align with my way of working.

This way you're saying the same thing but you're not blaming everyone in the company and the wording is less direct and it makes it more likely to be received as constructive feedback rather than venting.

first off - the eye strain issue is actually pretty common but totally fixable! get yourself a good blue light filter (either glasses or screen), adjust your screen brightness, and follow the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 mins look at something 20 feet away for 20 secs). these small changes made a huge difference for me.

given your love for math, problem-solving, and working independently, i think you're actually on the right track with data analytics! but here's something interesting to consider - have you thought about getting into AI/ML? its basically the perfect combo of math, problem solving, and analytics. plus with all the new AI tools coming out (like jenova ai which i built), theres huge demand for people who can work with these systems.

business analysis could work too but tbh its usually more about processes and stakeholder management than pure analytics. if you really enjoy the mathematical side of things, you might find it a bit limiting.

quick suggestion - try playing around with some AI tools to analyze data and see if you enjoy it. its a good way to test the waters without committing to anything. most modern AI platforms can help with data analysis, and seeing how they work might give you better insight into what aspects of the field interest you most.",lz3hdkg,careerguidance

There are a TON of transferable skills that aren't necessarily ""resume"" skills. Communication, public speaking, multitasking, etc.

It's a fantastic way to make enough money to pay your school, bills, rent etc. and only work 25-35 hours a week and the hours don't directly conflict with school hours. I also think it's not the worst place to end up working - you can live/move ANYWHERE and make a livable wage, but as others have said, it's always the best career long term.

One day you will likely take a pay cut, but it'll end up giving you benefits (401k, health, vision, dental, PTO, etc.) and then eventually you'll end up making more.

Granted, I have a BA and MA in history now too, and am working on a PhD, but even when I had to provide my educational documents to my boss to prove my qualifications, all she wanted was the two year social work degree. In some cities, that wouldn't be enough and you *would* need to have a BSW or even an MSW to get a social work job, so knowing what's available locally is always important.

If you put yourself in the managers shoes, offloading tasks is literally why you hire people. Have you ever worked somewhere and had wait too much work on your plate? The issue is typically that there's too much work for the number of staff, so to rectify that, it's good that they're hiring someone.

About the empty office--are some people allowed to work hybrid or remote? That would be a great question for them if you don't know yet--literally asking why the office seemed empty is fine! 

The only hesitation I would have is, and this is going to sound kind of bad, but are they always desperate and just hiring anyone? That could be indicative of larger issues and even put into question whether this is a high performing team/company that's trying to get good talent.

The fact is that in matter of months you are out of job anyway - likely, possibly. 

This 3 month role is the kind of role that will open you opportunities that you would not get without this 3 month role. 

What is your buffer financially speaking? Let’s say you take the 3 month role, you downgrade absolutely everything you possibly can and live on as little money as possible. How much realistically can you save? These savings plus what you already have - how many months can you sustain yourself? 

In business and in life there’s one rule: bigger the risk, bigger the reward. 

If I would have financial buffer for 3 months - that solves the problem doesn’t it? Then you have either 6 months in your current job, 3 months in the new one plus 3 month financial buffer to support yourself. 

6 months and 6 months. 

If this is the case, I would not even think twice but then again, I’m quite comfortable also taking risks.

Depends on where you're claiming asylum. Since you're still in a closet, it's unclear if you have sufficient evidence at the moment. Contact LGBT non-profit organizations in the country that you're thinking or consult a lawyer to see if this is a viable option or not. 

&gt;2) keep working til I get an offer from somewhere else, but that might take years.. 

You still need to financially support yourself so makes sense to do this until you have better options.

&gt;3) university, I've saved enough for that

You didn't mention the country, but this is typically the easiest and most direct way to immigrate for a lot of countries and usually have some pathways to work and then gain permanent residency. I think this is probably the most ideal imo because it doesn't tie your immigration status to your trans identity and you can come out at your own time if and when you feel safe in your new community. 

&gt;4) a friend wants to marry me, but I'll then be in the US and that's scary. Does open doors though. 

If this is not a true marriage but a charity gesture from your friend, it's technically immigration fraud and I wouldn't recommend it.

I've been doing better (?) these days, but since it happened very early in my career, it sort of stuck. I remember saying no to so many opportunities after that. It opened my eyes on what sort of job/environment/leadership I would absolutely not tolerate. 

Good luck to you! Don't be so hard on yourself, and chatgpt is your unpaid therapist.",lz1ekgs,careerguidance

Is leading you forward, where your heart will not crumble.

Not in the rush, nor the noise of the crowd,  
But in the stillness where your soul speaks loud.

Marriage or travel, a career or the rest,  
You are not behind, you're simply on your quest.  
The journey is yours, with no need for the race,  
Let go of the timing, and rest in your pace.

- Be realistic about the gap between you and them: the skills, knowledge, experience, industry and credentials they must have to earn what they do. You wouldn’t look at a neurologist making seven figures and compare their salary to yours, so why bother with comparing yourself an engineer who probably has a phd and a decade of experience?

- Take a hard look at your own compensation and compare it to others in your field. Are you behind, middle, or ahead of the pack? Chances are, there is someone doing the exact same job as you earning far, far less. 

- You’re 23 years old. In terms of your career growth, you’re still on the far left of the bell curve comp wise - I.e. you’re not even close to the highest earning potential that you’ll ever have. 

Finally, when you realize that life isn’t one giant dick measuring contest and that the only  person’s salary you need be concerned with is your own, you straight up won’t care. It’ll probably hit in about 10 or so years, but once it happens you’ll realize that the people who constantly compare themselves to others to measure their own self worth are incredibly insecure and will never be satisfied with their own achievements. (To be clear, I’m not saying that this is you now - you’re young and ambitious it’s to be expected - I’m talking about the people in the 30’s, 40’s and older who never get over this).

I’d look at jobs that might leverage skills you picked up as part of your education that aren’t the actual art creation.  IMO, your skillset likely meshes well with “Marketing”, but you’re going to have to advertise yourself in a different way than people who are graduating with degrees in other subjects that also align with that general industry.  Specifically:

Visual Composition - your fine arts background spent a ton of time educating you in “what looks good”.  In a world of marketing videos, backdrops, advertisements, etc.  this is something you have that someone with an English degree probably does not.

Branding/visual system - what colors do you use in your corporate materials, slide templates, intro/outro video bumpers.  There’s lots of need for this work, though it’s not always recognized.

Creative thinking - you had to make unique original art as part of your program.  People in other programs don’t, they learn analysis, stats, etc.  that’s something that you can potentially offer an employer that someone else may not.

Then there’s the other side which is: “how do I actually do this?”  You have a couple of options, but if you go the marketing route, you’ll want to look at entry-level positions.  I think a bigger firm would more readily recognize your talents (they have bigger teams and tend to be more open to specialty skillsets, IMO).  You could try a smaller firm, but you’ll likely be doing their art as well as needing to learn a lot of other skills like copywriting, tactics, persona analysis/targeting, routes, etc.  I think a bigger firm would allow you to pick up these skills as well, but it would be more gradual.  If you’re a one-person department or the department is small, you have to contribute in lots of ways pretty quickly.

You should also talk to your advisor (this isn’t the first time this has happened to someone) and maybe visit the alumni office to see what other people from your program are now doing.  They might have already stumbled into something you think is interesting and is a good match for your skills.

Getting an associates in Psychology seems like a hard turn, and reactionary.  If you want to do something like social work or therapy, it usually requires a masters, and many times the programs often don’t really care about the bachelor’s background you’re coming from, it’s all about GRE, GMAT, and the like.",lyx3brz,careerguidance

When my employer does that, it represents the entire range for that band. We hire at 30-40% penetration into the band, so the lowest third is useless information and we intend to promote by 60-70% penetration, so the uppermost third is also useless. A person would only go above 2/3 if they were ineligible for promotion long-term. In our case, we should be posting that middle third in order to give the applicants useful information about the job. I had a candidate ask for 120% of the upper limit, which in our case wasn’t even in the possible band. We tried to explain the situation, but it didn’t stick. We abandoned the candidate after some negotiations. 

If you think that your education and experience are right on target and that this is a step up for you, I would recommend going +20% or about $90K.

I’m currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at a consulting company in Brazil (technical leader), and I’m exploring ways to grow further in my career. My goal is to deepen my expertise as a specialist while staying close to technical development and problem-solving, as I truly enjoy that aspect of the work.

I’m curious about the possibilities within and beyond the typical Y-career framework (specialist vs. management). What path have you taken or are you considering to take? Where I work, even specialists often end up dealing with a lot of management tasks, and I’m concerned about focusing more on managing the team than on solving technical problems.

I’d also love to hear your thoughts on what skills and knowledge are most valuable for senior data scientists, particularly in big tech environments like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft. What do you consider to be essential skills, and what would most help in the selection process to work in such companies? I’m studying to refine my skill set and want to focus on areas that are most relevant for long-term growth.

I’d appreciate any advice on which path might be better for my long-term career. Here’s the breakdown:
	1.	Option 1: Post-grad Internship in the Judicial Sector
	•	Focus: Automation,  Applied AI and BI within the judicial sector, where I’d likely work with generative AI (Gen AI), NLP, automation tools, power BI as well as platforms like Azure, it could have some traditional ml later maybe, but due to the area probably more gen ai(AI is a growing sector there).
	•	Pros:
	•	Strong focus on Gen AI and NLP, which are areas of growing demand and align with current trends in AI development.
	•	The internship pays about 50% more per hour than the other role, and even after covering the required post-grad program, I’d still earn more.
	•	Shorter hours (6h/day), giving me the flexibility to pursue freelance projects in Gen AI and automation—something I’ve been planning to do.
	•	Cons:
	•	It’s an internship, which may not carry as much weight on my resume as a full-time role.
	•	The post-grad program is mandatory and adds to my workload, though it could be a good learning opportunity and addition to resume.
	•	Growth: Advancement or a full-time position would depend on vacancies, but the salary jump in this sector would likely be much higher if I were hired permanently.
	2.	Option 2: Full-Time Role in Economic and Social Research
	•	Focus: Data science work in a research-oriented organization that focuses on economic and social studies. This would involve statistical analysis, causal inference, and potentially traditional machine learning models.
	•	Pros:
	•	Opportunity to deepen my knowledge in areas like causal inference, which I currently have limited experience in.
	•	Working on research projects with potential social impact, which could be valuable for my resume.
	•	A full-time role means I could officially list “Data Scientist” as my job title, even if the official designation differs slightly.
	•	Cons:
	•	Salary is very low for the area , even tho it’s a full time role (2,000/month).
	•	Like the internship, growth depends on vacancies, but the potential salary increase is smaller than in the judicial sector.
	•	Growth: While the role provides a strong foundation in data science, I might miss out on cutting-edge developments in AI, like Gen AI and NLP, which are less likely to be a focus here.

Other Factors to Consider:
	•	Both roles are within public organizations, and advancement in either position would depend on factors outside my control, such as vacancies or people leaving their roles.

•	I already have a short-term data science experience listed on my resume, but I’m unsure if transitioning to a post-graduate internship afterward might look like a “setback” to potential employers.

	•	The judicial internship has a stronger focus on Gen AI and NLP, while the research role emphasizes traditional data science techniques like causal inference. This makes the former more specialized and the latter more foundational.
	•	Although the research role has a lower salary, it could provide me with a broader skill set and strengthen areas I haven’t worked on much before.
	•	The flexibility of the internship (6h/day) could make it easier to grow my freelance work in Gen AI and automation, which I’ve been planning to do.
	•	If I choose the internship, I’m wondering if having both an autonomous freelance project and the post-grad program simultaneously would balance out the fact that it’s “just” an internship.

The Big Question:
Should I prioritize the full-time research role for its foundational focus on economic and social studies, or the judicial internship for being able to focus more on AI, NLP, and higher hourly pay? Would taking an internship after a short-term experience in data science seem like a step backward, or could I frame the specialization ane and added freelance work as an advantage?

Usually there are a mix of priors that factor into the decision to run any particular experiment, and it can be extremely helpful to know what these assumptions were. Once you have these in hand, you can interrogate them one by one, which can potentially shed light on why the experiment failed to deliver the results the organization was looking for. Let's imagine a marketing campaign, one that was designed to generate increased sales. The team might have made two assumptions: (1) That you would be able to reach 15% of the US population with the campaign and (2) that three specific consumer segments would respond positively.  If the results failed to materialize, this could be (a) because the campaign failed to achieve the desired geographical reach or (b) because the campaign reached the relevant audiences, but they responded negatively  (or (c) - i.e., for any number of other reasons). If you can explain to the team that the problem was (a) vs (b), they can better understand where to improve in the future -- is it a question of improving the creative content of the campaign, or is it about improving the delivery of the advertisements? This kind of ""diagnostic"" explanation can provide a better route forward for future experiments, and it involves confirming or refuting the assumptions that lie behind the experiment. 

Another way to think about this kind of ask is in terms of mathematical decomposition. If the net result is composed of multiple underlying factors that can be separately measured, you can report those separately and explain which was driving the impact. For example, imagine that we ran an experiment where we lowered the price of a retail product, and were hoping to see increased sales. You could perhaps demonstrate that the impact of price changes can be decomposed into two factors: Own Price Elasticity (consumers reacting to the item's own price) and Cross Elasticity (consumers reacting to the price *gap* between the item and competitive items). You might find that, while your own price went down, other competitive prices fell by even *more*. This could mean that the impact from Own Price Elasticity was positive (i.e., the experiment drove more volume via this mechanism), but the impact from Cross Price Elasticity was negative. This mathematical decomposition can should ""why"" the experiment failed.

In terms of what the PM and engineers are really asking for, though, here's the best bet: They have spent time and effort developing something, and they want to see it succeed. They want to be recognized for its impact and compensated accordingly, and they don't want to feel as though their hours were a waste. So they are hoping to find some way to still leverage the model / experiment / tool / etc to drive value for the company. One way you can do this is exactly what you suggested: Stratify the results by various segments or dimensions, measure the uplift to determine if the experiment might be useful for some subsegment of the population, and be sure to [leverage statistical measures to ensure that your finding isn't solely due to chance.](https://xkcd.com/882/) If you can find a way to still use their experiment in a profitable way, that's a win for everyone involved.

To break this down:

**1. Understand the Assumptions**

\- Start by revisiting the hypothesis behind the feature. What specific problem was it meant to solve or metric to improve? Were there assumptions about user behaviour, timing, or specific segments that might not have held true?

\- Have a conversation with the PM and engineers about their thought process during development. Often, you’ll uncover overlooked variables or potential misalignments between the feature’s intended use and how users actually interacted with it.

**2. Diagnose the Experiment**

\- **Usage Analysis:** Was the feature adopted by users at all? If usage was low, that could explain flat results.

\- **Technical Issues:** Double-check if the feature was implemented correctly. Bugs, confusing UI, or inconsistent deployment could derail any test.

\- **Funnel Analysis:** Map the user journey for interacting with the feature. Identify drop-offs or areas where users disengaged - this can often reveal opportunities for improvement.

\- **Segment Analysis:** Slice the results across key dimensions (e.g., geography, user type, device) to see if there’s a particular group that responded positively or negatively. If a segment performed well, that could inform a targeted rollout or iteration.

**3. Communicate the Results Clearly**

\- Emphasise that a statistically insignificant result is not a failure - it’s a learning opportunity. Many tests don’t yield significant results but still provide valuable insights into user behaviour.

\- If you do find a subgroup or a hypothesis worth pursuing further, ensure that any new experiment is designed with sufficient power to detect meaningful effects.

**4. Propose Next Steps**

\- If the data shows potential for improvement (e.g., a specific user segment responded well or there’s evidence of confusion in a certain part of the funnel), propose ways to iterate on the feature.

\- If the data doesn’t suggest a clear path forward, don’t shy away from recommending that the feature be deprioritised. It’s better to focus resources on higher-impact initiatives.

**What Are They Really Asking?**

It’s likely a mix of things:

\- They’re invested in the feature and want to avoid writing it off as a waste of effort.

\- They need a narrative to explain the results to stakeholders - whether that’s “it didn’t work, here’s why” or “it worked for X group, so we’ll refine and try again.”

\- They might want reassurance that the test itself wasn’t flawed.

Non- inferiority tests are used when there is a reason to prefer another option, but that option may not be superior to the currently deployed one. For example, an option may be cheaper, easier to use, or more secure. Non-inferiority testing is a mainstay of pharmaceutical trials where a new drug is judged against the active control (i.e., the standard of care) because it would be unethical to test it against the placebo.

It’s worth noting that you cannot convert a superiority trial to a non-inferiority trial after the fact. However, it is typically justifiable to convert a non-inferiority trial to a superiority trial when if the evidence supports that. So it doesn’t help you in your current situation but maybe be useful in the future when engineers want to demonstrate that their product is no worse than the currently deployed product.  

Someone above mention validity – one thing to keep in mind is that because non-inferiority in essence lowers the bar, it is slightly easier at times to get a non inferior result.

Then you could split that up into random train and test sets, stratifying on churn rate. I think this is valid assuming no correlations between users. Alternatively 
Your train set could be all user outcomes for 2 months ago and the test set could be all user outcomes for last month. That way  when you do the rolling window below you can have test predictions for all historical outcomes but trade off not always using the latest info. The same user could show up in both sets here if they didn't churn the first month but that's fine they will have new feature values because:

Either way The features for each user each month should include info about their behavior over the previous twelve months. So maybe different levels of aggregates. If the model can do well on the test set you can assume it will do well for all user outcomes next month. 

But if you want to do one better, take this setup and roll it back one month at a time and then gather all the predictions on test sets together for a better view of model performance while you hyper parameter tune and feature engineer, ie.

I would approach the data construction almost like cross-validation over time AND customers. For example: restrict training data to months 1-6.

Then 1-8 predicting churn in month 9 on an entirely other set of customers, so on.

something like,

    df  # all data here
    # assumptions: data has columns ""customer_id"", ""date"" - the date of features for that record, ""churn_date"" - the date that the customer discontinued the subscription
    non_churn_sample_size = 123  # the number of non-churned customers to include in each subset. Can be static like this, or sample a number equal to the number of churns for each time period.
    frames = []
    used_customers = []
    
    # subset 1: customers that churned in 2024-05
    df1 = df[(df['date'] &lt; '2024-05') &amp; ~(df['customer_id'].isin(used_customers))] 
    # find customer IDs of those who churned in 2024-05
    df1_churned_customers = df[df['churn_date'].apply(lambda x: '2024-05' in x)]['customer_id'].values
    # find customer IDs of those who churned AFTER 2024-05 or are still active, but SAMPLE them
    df1_active_customers = df[(df['churn_date'].isna()) | (df['churn_date'] &gt; '2024-05'])]['customer_id'].sample(non_churn_sample_size)  # sample(len(df1_churned_customers)) for 50-50 split of churn/non-churn

    # create the target flag column
    df1['churned'] = df1['customer_id'].isin(churn1_customers)
    # filter to churned and sampled non-churn customers
    df1 = df1[(df1['customer_id'].isin(df1_active_customers)) | (df1['customer_id'].isin(churn1_customers))]
    # update the used customer ID list with current frame
    used_customers.extend(df1['customer_id'].values)
    
    frames.append(df1)
    
    
    # subset 2 customers that churned in 2024-06
    df2 = df[(df['date'] &lt; '2024-06') &amp; ~(df['customer_id'].isin(used_customers))]

    ....
    
    
    # done, aggregate
    new_df = pd.concat(frames, ignore_index=True)


This method should have a few advantages:

1. You make use of training on churn that occurs throughout multiple months, as opposed to only using the churn from the most recent month.

2. By ensuring each customer only appears in one ""slice"" of the training data, you avoid duplicating customer entries and over-emphasizing the features of those customers.

A potential drawback is that careful consideration of feature selection or engineering will be required to account for the fact that this data will not cover a uniform length of time. One potential fix to this is to limit features to be based on the ""most recent X months"".

Use **one record per customer** only if you’re okay with losing those month-to-month dynamics.

**Option 1: One record per customer per month**

This is what I’d recommend for churn prediction, especially in a subscription model where customer behavior often shifts leading up to a churn event. Here’s how it would work:

	•	For every customer, create a record for **each month** in your 12-month window.

	•	The features in each record would describe the customer’s state in **that specific month** (e.g., monthly spend, engagement, complaints, subscription tier, etc.).

	•	Label the record as “churn = 1” if the customer churns in the **next month**, and “churn = 0” otherwise.

For example:

	•	A customer who didn’t churn at all in 12 months would have 12 rows, all labeled churn = 0.

	•	A customer who churned in March would have rows for January and February labeled churn = 0 and the row for February labeled churn = 1 (since they churned in March).

**Why it’s great:**

	1.	**You capture temporal trends**: The model can pick up on patterns like “engagement dropped 3 months before churn.”

	2.	**More data**: This approach gives you more training samples, which can improve performance, especially if churn is rare.

	3.	**Behavior snapshots**: You’re giving the model the ability to understand how behavior changes month to month.

**Challenges:**

	•	You’ll need to carefully create features for each customer-month record (like making sure you’re not leaking future data).

	•	The dataset can get big—imagine 1M customers with 12 records each!

**Option 2: One record per customer**

Here, you just summarize the customer’s data into a single record for the entire 12 months (or just use their state from the most recent month). For customers who churned, you’d include features up to the month before they churned.

Example:

	•	Customer who didn’t churn → one row summarizing their last 12 months.

	•	Customer who churned in March → one row summarizing their data as of February.

**Why it’s simpler:**

	1.	**Easier to manage**: No need to deal with month-to-month snapshots.

	2.	**Fewer rows**: The dataset is smaller, so training is faster and easier.

**But it has downsides:**

	•	You lose **temporal information**, which can be super important for churn. A customer gradually disengaging over time is a common precursor to churn, and this structure won’t capture that.

**What I’d recommend:**

Use **Option 1** if you want your model to pick up on **behavioral trends over time**. This is especially useful in a subscription business where churn is influenced by changes in engagement, usage, etc. Use **Option 2** only if you’re pressed for simplicity or don’t have monthly-level data.

1. **For active customers**: You would create multiple records for them, one for each month in the 12-month period. Each record would have features for that specific month, with a label indicating if they churned the following month (1 for churn, 0 for no churn). This helps the model learn customer behavior over time.
2. **For customers who churned**: You would only need a single record for the month they churned. The label would indicate they churned in the next month, and the features would capture their behavior leading up to that point.

This way, you're capturing customer behavior dynamically each month and your model will be able to detect trends in churn risk based on changes over time.

For a churn model predicting whether a customer will churn in the next month, your training set should consist of monthly snapshots of each customer’s data over the past 12 months. This means that if a customer has been active and not churned during the entire year, you would have 12 records for that customer - one for each month - with features reflecting their status at that time.

By structuring your data this way, you capture the temporal dynamics and allow the model to learn patterns that lead to churn. Customers who have churned will have records up until the month before they churned, with the last record indicating that they did churn in the following month.

AI engineering skills will enhance your marketing analytics skills, but less so the other way. Most people in early career don't know what niche they want yet and the first role is more pluripotent imo.

Others have mentioned solid reasons why #2 might be better. Here are my opinions on a handful of them:

- 'It sounds like a silly prompt engineering job': Even prompt engineering can be very interesting. It's more than just rephrasing questions to a chatbot. I've been thinking about soft prompt + QLoRA workflows for POCs from a single internal foundation model. And I read something from Andrew Ng recently suggesting many teams should do more prompt engineering first. And I read a cool paper from Chinese lab (forget which. Baidu?)  where they synthesized a whole bunch of personas. And i'd say prompt engineering is an important part of agentic workflows too
- 'you might get laid off': if you assume you will be laid off, which experience would you prefer on your resume? In your early career, you aren't losing as much imo. Many in our industry level up and bag raises by moving from company to company anyways. Marketing analytics sounds possibly easy to automate too
- 'you will be forgotten since no one will see you': if the culture is remote first, you will be seen as much as you proactively interact with others. You could also be a wallflower in an office. It's what you make of it. Maybe it'd matter more if you already know you want to stay and grow with the company. In my experience, the workers with the most negotiating power always have a foot out the door anyways.
- 'you may not add much value in role #1': true or not, why does this matter? The company's goals aren't your career goals. You can gain a lot of real world hands on experience on the company's dime. If that's what they asked for, it's not on you if they squandered money. Just be prepared for the layoff and look elsewhere to advance; you should never stop upskilling in this field anyways and if you were looking elsewhere to begin with, it's not difficult news to process.
- 'you won't scratch your social need for in-person interaction': fair point, but you can fill your social meter outside work too. A lot of remote-first companies have in-person events too.

But tbh, I think the most important thing to look at is salary and compensation, which is the biggest determinant of what your next raise looks like.

I'm not surprised everyone here is saying Marketing Scientist at the bigger company, that makes sense as this sub tends to not really like LLMs. I'd say the AI Engineer role would be the one I'd pick if I were for you for a few different reasons:

1) More technical (if I understand your post)

2) Fully remote (you can get really good mentorship/teambuilding in the right remote environment, and sometimes office life can suckkkkkkk)

3) LLM adoption has been widespread and quick - they are here to stay and getting in earlier is better

However I will say this (as someone who has had jobs centered around LLMs for the last few years): it may have a pigeon-hole effect, I have noticed since I started that it is a lot harder for me to stand out in terms of traditional ML/SW/DS jobs. I'm not sure if this is due to the current market, or if it is because there is a tendency to be pigeon-holed, but an easy fix for this could be just removing LLM references on any resume and focusing on the general SW side of things.

AI engineer definitely is the sexier sounding role, but from experience and what I've seen on the market, those roles are mainly companies saying they want to do AI and saying they need an AI person to train some bullshit in house model or just prompt engineer. I can't say 100% that's what the first job is, but unless they're asking you detailed questions about how to fine tune LLM's (stuff like Lora, RAG, multi-GPU training, efficient inference and deployment, etc) it's probably a hype type job where they use GPT and call it ""their model"".

Never been in marketing, but my fiancee is in that field now and you'll get a lot more real world experience with creating, training, fine tuning, and (most important for a new grad) deploying ML models to production. On top of that, you'll probably get exposed to stuff like casual inference which can be very valuable for future job prospects. Doing a bunch of sklearn stuff doesn't sound as sexy as LLM time, but long term you'll probably benefit the most.

I’d also appreciate any advice on which path might be better for my long-term career. Here’s the breakdown:
	1.	Option 1: Post-grad Internship in the Judicial Sector
	•	Focus: Automation,  Applied AI and BI within the judicial sector, where I’d likely work with generative AI (Gen AI), NLP, automation tools, power BI as well as platforms like Azure, it could have some traditional ml later maybe, but due to the area probably more gen ai(AI is a growing sector there).
	•	Pros:
	•	Strong focus on Gen AI and NLP, which are areas of growing demand and align with current trends in AI development.
	•	The internship pays about 50% more per hour than the other role, and even after covering the required post-grad program, I’d still earn more.
	•	Shorter hours (6h/day), giving me the flexibility to pursue freelance projects in Gen AI and automation—something I’ve been planning to do.
	•	Cons:
	•	It’s an internship, which may not carry as much weight on my resume as a full-time role.
	•	The post-grad program is mandatory and adds to my workload, though it could be a good learning opportunity and addition to resume.
	•	Growth: Advancement or a full-time position would depend on vacancies, but the salary jump in this sector would likely be much higher if I were hired permanently.
	2.	Option 2: Full-Time Role in Economic and Social Research
	•	Focus: Data science work in a research-oriented organization that focuses on economic and social studies. This would involve statistical analysis, causal inference, and potentially traditional machine learning models.
	•	Pros:
	•	Opportunity to deepen my knowledge in areas like causal inference, which I currently have limited experience in.
	•	Working on research projects with potential social impact, which could be valuable for my resume.
	•	A full-time role means I could officially list “Data Scientist” as my job title, even if the official designation differs slightly.
	•	Cons:
	•	Salary is very low for the area , even tho it’s a full time role (2,000/month).
	•	Like the internship, growth depends on vacancies, but the potential salary increase is smaller than in the judicial sector.
	•	Growth: While the role provides a strong foundation in data science, I might miss out on cutting-edge developments in AI, like Gen AI and NLP, which are less likely to be a focus here.

Other Factors to Consider:
	•	Both roles are within public organizations, and advancement in either position would depend on factors outside my control, such as vacancies or people leaving their roles.

•	I already have a short-term data science experience listed on my resume, but I’m unsure if transitioning to a post-graduate internship afterward might look like a “setback” to potential employers.

	•	The judicial internship has a stronger focus on Gen AI and NLP, while the research role emphasizes traditional data science techniques like causal inference. This makes the former more specialized and the latter more foundational.
	•	Although the research role has a lower salary, it could provide me with a broader skill set and strengthen areas I haven’t worked on much before.
	•	The flexibility of the internship (6h/day) could make it easier to grow my freelance work in Gen AI and automation, which I’ve been planning to do.
	•	If I choose the internship, I’m wondering if having both an autonomous freelance project and the post-grad program simultaneously would balance out the fact that it’s “just” an internship.

The Big Question:
Should I prioritize the full-time research role for its foundational focus on economic and social studies, or the judicial internship for being able to focus more on AI, NLP, and higher hourly pay? Would taking an internship after a short-term experience in data science seem like a step backward, or could I frame the specialization ane and added freelance work as an advantage?",lywpx9i,datascience

That’s no small feat, especially in today’s competitive job market. Both roles sound interesting, but since you’re leaning toward the AI Engineer position, let me break it down for you and explain why I think that’s the better choice for your long-term growth.

1. Future-Proofing Your Career: The AI Engineer role focuses on building large language models (LLMs), which are at the cutting edge of tech right now. AI and machine learning are rapidly growing fields, and having hands-on experience with LLMs will put you in a strong position to capitalize on this trend. Even if you decide to shift roles later, having “AI Engineer” and experience with LLMs on your resume will open a lot of doors.
2. Transferable Skills: The technical expertise you gain in an AI Engineer role will be highly transferable across industries. Whether you decide to stay in tech, pivot to research, or even move into applied areas like healthcare or finance, this role sets a solid foundation. Plus, technical skills often command higher salaries and better opportunities over time.
3. Workplace Interaction: I totally understand your hesitation about the fully remote aspect, especially since you value in-person interactions. But many remote roles still have ways to build community—team meetings, virtual hangouts, or even periodic offsite events. Plus, you can balance this by joining local meetups or communities related to your field. The independence you gain from remote work could also help you grow personally and professionally.
4. Career Titles Matter (Early On): In the early stages of your career, job titles can make a big difference. “AI Engineer” has more technical prestige and tends to carry more weight when you’re looking to make your next move. “Marketing Scientist,” while valuable, might pigeonhole you into a niche that’s harder to pivot out of later.
5. The Stats + Data Science Angle: With your background in statistics and modeling, the AI Engineer role aligns better with the skills you’ve been building. You’ve already mentioned that you’ve done projects and internships in data science—this is your chance to take those skills to the next level. While the Marketing Scientist role sounds client-facing and analytical, it might not challenge or stretch your technical abilities in the same way.

Lastly, remember that while workplace interactions are important, the growth opportunities you get early in your career can have a bigger impact in the long run. You can always seek out networking and social opportunities outside of work, but getting your foot in the door of a cutting-edge field like AI doesn’t come around every day.

* **AI Engineer (Fully Remote)**: This sounds like a strong opportunity for growth, especially with the focus on LLMs, which are in high demand. If you're passionate about AI and technical challenges, this could set you up for a great future. However, the fully remote aspect might be tricky if you value in-person interaction. Being remote can sometimes feel isolating, but it can also offer flexibility and work-life balance.
* **Marketing Scientist (Office-based)**: This role might give you a more social, collaborative environment, with direct client interactions. If you enjoy working closely with people and problem-solving in a business context, this could be more fulfilling. However, the focus on marketing might not align with your passion for technical/statistical work in the long term.

Since you're early in your career, **growth potential** and **job satisfaction** should weigh heavily in your decision. If you’re excited by AI and the potential of working on cutting-edge technology, the AI Engineer role might be the better long-term bet. However, if you think you’ll miss social interactions and enjoy a mix of technical and business challenges, the Marketing Scientist role could be a more balanced fit.

I tried this out with a dataset containing events when participant casted votes on a certain polling platform. 

Key issues right away: 

- ""A ML model has been trained to predict [Column]"" - why was this variable chosen as the target? What ML model? What was the CV/training process? Imo misleading for non-technical people, and an absurdity for data scientists

- Numerical column containing only 3 distinct values was automatically considered as continuous, meaning that most visualizations don't make sense

- Ran correlation analysis on multiple numeric columns, despite one being categorical, and the other 2 columns were IDs (specified in the name)

- Despite the ML model absolutely failing, the model results &amp; followup were nevertheless generated. 

Actually the tool correctly identified a timestamp in UNIX format and was able to create visualizations based on this; This is fairly nice, although probably not complicated. 

I'd never use this tool out of the box without understanding the data on my own (what do the columns represent, metadata, etc.). I'd write Python/R code to generate further insights that I am actually interested in instead of relying on an AI tool to do that for me.",lygchut,datascience

Like my company's DSs soundly rejected Sagemaker because it doesn't fill a need, it invented a need that none of us agree with.

EDA, experimenting with the data and working out processing steps that should happen before modelling is all scrappy notebook work and I like that. I'll need to abstract code for my finalised process into proper data pipeline modules for deployment but that's fine! I don't want to be thinking about that step when I'm experimenting.

Likewise, model development is my own business. Even if I want to use a tool like MLFlow, I do not want to integrate that experimentation into a broader data exploration and deployment tool. It's too much to think about when I'm trying to do my job. Plus, when I use a tool like Sagemaker to integrate the whole process, I can't do things my way.

There is a certain universality to CLI tools that makes developing these full, personalized, end-to-end workflows feel within the realm of reach of a weekend. (Even though it ultimately takes somewhat longer to get it ""just right""). I am not a data scientist, but I do understand the pain points of your workflow and can see tightly correlated analogous issues as a computational physicist. I have grown to understand the benefits of CLI tools and writing short helper scripts to patch up my workflow for at least the next three months until some other pain point is encountered.   
  
And once those scripts are written, they are very unlikely to change since CLI interfaces are updated rather carefully and judiciously. Eventually, within the span of a few months to a year, you start to piece together all of those 'one part of the puzzles' tools that people recommend online and you have an almost muscle-memory like workflow (that new CLI nerds dream romantically of achieving, but get too distracted by rather noisy pain points and end up patching too eagerly).   
  
While that were my thoughts about end-to-end workflows, I concede that I could be blissfully unaware of some genuinely interesting problems in datascience workflow automations.

Is it a column that is null due to merging in data from another source and the nulls should be filled in as zero? (e.g. number of doctor visits in the last year, amount of debt). If so, fill it with zero. Huzzah.

Are the nulls due to shoddy data collection and every observation SHOULD have a value? This is squirrelly and there are risks with any choice. Low-fidelity data is risky.

If it is high-fidelity data and perhaps the column is only filled out in special circumstances but it IS meaningful in those special circumstances, shouldn't be filled with zeros, and actually has a variety of values, I'd leave it as-is because the algorithms I typically use (tree-based) can handle missing values in the X just fine.

I don't typically do imputation. I'm usually either using models that can handle null values or handling experimentation data in which we would throw out incomplete data.

There’s no universal rule—data isn’t linear, and its value often depends on how features relate to one another and to your target.

I'm betting to impute missing values for columns with many non-nulls (say 80–90%), especially if the feature correlates well with others. When non-nulls drop to around 50–70%, things get trickier. If the feature has a strong relationship with other variables or the target, I find a regression model like XGBoost can often do an average to ""average plus"" fill the gaps. But if it’s only loosely connected to the rest of the data, imputation might add noise.

For features with less than 50% non-nulls, it’s worth questioning their value. Sparse columns aren’t inherently bad, but keeping them might do more harm than good if they don’t add much predictive power.",lygeq6x,datascience

I’d also consider running a data profiler to get a better sense of the different correlation coefficients and look at the missingno dendrograms and interactions to see if there’s any funny business going on that might give some insight into the nulls.

It's not exactly that SQL is intuitive. I have plenty of beefs with SQL, but I've tripped over pretty much every gotcha there is and so if I want to get it right first time I'll grab SQL.

In terms of count(value) being a trick because of NULL, I mean yes, but... why are you saying count(value) rather than count(1)?  The whole point of count(X) is that it counts if X is not-null and not if it is null.  So you use 1 if you simply want to count rows.

And yes, the syntax is esoteric in places.  People like to point out: select VALUES from TABLE where CONDITION and go this is practically English.  And that's true to a point, but GROUP BY and HAVING? or the flip from WHERE to AND? Or having to repeat your aggregate in the select in most variants? Your post points out the issues with analytic functions... I find how IN handles NULL to be nastier to the point I tend to use WHERE EXISTS even in situations that IN is adequate. SQL much shows its age.

But... well, the problem with alternatives is that every data scientist knows SQL.  I can collaborate with anyone.  Let's say I were a fan of dplyr, I've immediately ruled out maybe half the potential collaborators.

There is often more than one way to write a SQL query and some are more readable than others.

With any language there comes a point where you begin to think in that language, or at least have your thought process shaped by that language. As an ex-DBA who worked closely with Data Scientists they  were great at finding stuff about the data and about the world that data described.

The only thing I really don't appreciate though is the fact, that version control and proper style guides aren't established in most companies or not on a rigorous level.
SQL readability increases drastically from proper formatting and documentation.

Some of my initial (and random) thoughts:

- If your employer is paying for it, absolutely get a masters. It’s the better long term play and will get you through filters in future applications. I know you plan to stay at your current job for 5 years, but life hardly ever goes the way we plan it.

- not relevant here, as your work is paying for it, but “degree prestige” is mostly BS, and the ROI hardly ever works out. It’s almost always best to go for as cheap a one as you can get away with.

- If speed of completion is the main factor, go for eastern. It can be done fast, assumes no previous knowledge, and isn’t too rigorous from what i hear. This option to me is to “just to get the piece of paper”, and get a very “applied” bootcamp style curriculum / no math proofs etc.
- if you want a rigorous program, and actually learn a lot, either of the 2 gatech programs will give you that (omscs being tougher obviously). Between the 2 programs it really depends on what you want to do, but a lot of the courses overlap so see which courses you are interested in taking, and choose based on that. 

These are the choices im trying to make next year:
Do I want my masters degree asap (eastern), or do i want to take a lot more time with a gatech degree (likely omscs)? Or do I maybe skip getting a masters at all for the time being? Choices.. choices..",lyf724b,datascience

When I'm doing EDA, including EDA where I build a model, I'm going to use a notebook.  They're near perfect at capturing the interactive exploration.

Once I'm pretty happy with the model, I no longer want loops over hyperparmeters or explorations of alternatives.  I need to essentially rewrite.

At that point you can stick to notebooks, and you get a nicely written notebook suitable for putting into production.  Or you can rewrite in pure python.

My experience is the rewrite in pure python is a very effective stage-gate.  It stops active exploration and basically says 'the DS task is finished now'.  So, I rewrite more for cultural reasons than technical.

One issue I've found is that long after the model goes into production, if the operational support escalates to DS then the first thing the DS wants to is spin it up in a notebook.  If you've rewritten it in Python then that's an absolute pain, and so I've been doing a few experiments with keeping it in notebooks for easier debugging.

Personally I don't think it's a solved problem.  One thing that really helps is Artifactory or similar - the more of your company's code you can get out of the notebook and handed over to engineering, the easier it is to bounce back and forwards between production and experimentation.

PS: If we're doing enhancement requests on notebooks, one of my problems is the opposite.  When I'm exploring I do so in a roughly linear way, going deep on the first bit, then settling on something and going deep on the second, and so on.  Notebooks are great for running things and most support 'chapters' but I've never met one that supported a true tree structure.

Also it doesn't become outdated over time as the client inevitably fails to keep up with documentation.

Simple things like showing the shape of a dataframe or a .head(3) after some engineering code to evidence that it has worked at each step is key to making a client feel good. Extra quality of life steps like showing an example interaction to demonstrate a point.

I push people I work with to write pure Python scripts, not Jupyter notebooks. Unless the intent is to have a (basically static) document for presentation or future use as a reference. 

I think the historical reason that they became ingrained in the Python data science culture / workflow is that they addressed two needs:

1. An interactive environment (IDE) for initial EDA and code development, when you need to look at a lot of small things that ultimately won't need to end up being preserved somewhere. 
2. A more report-like mixture of text and code that in itself is relatively static but which you might want to refer back to at some point in the future. (Jupyter notebooks are also pretty good as a teaching aid, which I'd fit into this category as well.)

I came to Python from the R world, and for me point #1 is basically a reflection of the fact there were wasn't a good IDE for Python data science work akin to RStudio in the R ecosystem. But that's not the case anymore. VS Code is pretty good at this now, and the related [Positron IDE](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) is very promising I think. 

For the 2nd use case, Jupyter notebooks are alright, but I'd argue [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is better: the source is pretty similar to plain markdown, you can compile it to markdown (or other formats), and it doesn't involve underlying JSON and thus works better with git.

You should determine which materials you should 'revise' and which materials you should 'study'.

In my opinion:

You can revise SQL by doing practice problems - you don't need to study about DB and basic syntax again, the best way to learn is just doing one or two practice problems.

Probability teasers and statistics I think is best practiced via ChatGPT and you can revise there. Here's a prompt I recommend:

&gt;""I want you to be an interviewer that's writing an interview plan for a new Data Science role that's opening up. Your interview plan will be focused on one area of study: Statistics and probabilities. Generate 10 practical scenario questions that interviewers can select from. The questions should cover distribution functions, hypothesis testing, conditional probabilities, correlation vs. causation vs. covariance, and questions on how to explain certain mathematical concepts in layman's term such as Confidence Interval, Type I or Type II errors, etc. Under each of the questions, list bullet points of what the interviewer should look for in the answer.""

Behavioral is best learned by listening to a lot of YouTube videos on Behavioral type questions.

In other words, sketch out a STAR response related to the job functions (STAR=Situation, Task, Action, Result). Some places will ask you batshit questions that you can't really prep for, but most behavioral questions will link back to the job posting. 

Perhaps the hardest part of STAR responses is thinking up the best example in the moment. So just have some prepared before hand. Keep your initial response brief, like 45-60 seconds. Besides being underprepared, the number one mistake I see applicants make in interviews is a 5 minute uninterrupted monologue that meanders well past the original point of the question. 

My other advice for the interview itself is to take a moment or two to gather your thoughts before responding. As an interviewer, I'd rather deal with an uncomfortable 5-10 seconds following a question while you get ready to provide a thoughtful answer rather than have you start rambling without a plan on how to answer the question.

Companies vary dramatically in what they ask and knowing which area to prep for can make a significant difference. Search online for company specific info. Paying for a mock interview on Prepfully or similar can also be a good idea. You should also just ask them directly.

Behavioral questions are worth prepping for a little bit but if you're not good at making up BS there's only so much you can do. There's a reason I'm in DS not sales.

There are two types of data scientists: research and product. 

Here is what I am advising all the time to the candidates:

* Watch Emma Ding channel on YouTube. Especially the videos about product sense. A data scientist interview is a product management interview backed with statistical theory.  This is the communication part and the trickiest one if you never worked in tech before.

* Read Trutworthy Online Experiment, a kind of a bible for A/B testing.

* Master the basics of statistical inference and learn their definition and the ability to explain to anyone in multiple fashions. (What is hypothesis testing? Why does p-value matter? Why not? What is alpha/beta/power, confidence intervals? Assumptions of regression, caveats, pitfalls, biases?) aim for the ability to make small example showing why these matters? I personally used Regression and Other stories from Gelman to study and I now work for Google (correlation or causation? XD).

* Coding: it is either SQL for DS product or (Python/R) for DS research. SQL is around medium level difficulty (a few joins, group by, maybe window function). As for DS research, I coded in R for years, but I would still do the interview in Python: most of the problems require to manipulate data structure, and Python has the advantage of having a syntax for hash maps that will give you a joker to get out of trouble. What matters is the way you solve the question: explain in words what you want to execute and ask for feedback before writing the code, maybe your interviewer might say that there would be a different way. Keep your learning around core language, don’t expect to have questions about libs, unless you wrote them on your CV.

For Product Data Science role at Google, you'll also want to master A/B testing. Read the book Trustworthy Online Experiments if you've got a lot of time. 

For ""Research Data Science"" you'll need more heavy-duty Data Structures &amp; Algorithms skills in Python so go to a site like LeetCode/NeetCode for that practice. For Product Data Science @ Google, it'll be more SQL heavy, so practice on [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/questions) for that (has a few Google questions on it!).",lxxbrva,datascience

My advice is:
- Revisit logistic regression (I had 2 separate interviewers ask me about this). Understand what it is, all the cases you’d want to use it, how to assess the validity/relevance of each covariate, and how to optimise and fine tune logistic regression 
- Revisit SQL, especially sub-queries (eg “WITH temp_table AS (sub…query) select * from temp_table)
- Revisit SQL window functions, ranking functions, etc.
- Pick a random Google product, and just go through the exercise of like “If I had to own the analytics for a specific feature of this product, how might I measure it?”)
- Brush up on A/B testing (eg “what is a type 2 error?”)

Logistic regression is sort of the Swiss Army knife of prediction problems (eg “will this user subscribe?”) and is manageable/simple enough for an interview.

My understanding is that the first technical phone screen interviews are handed out to random googlers who get random questions from a question bank.

Your approach of using supervised feature importance to guide clustering is fundamentally sound, but you’re essentially mixing two different objectives - your target variable’s optimization and natural data patterns. This can blind you to important clusters that don’t correlate with your target. For your 2-cluster issue, silhouette score is being too conservative - definitely try hierarchical clustering to visualize how your data naturally groups, and use multiple metrics (elbow, gap statistic) since they often reveal different optimal k values. Don’t just trust one metric blindly.

I'm currently enrolled on the ML Specialisation on Coursera and plan to take the Deep Learning Spec straight after.

With all of that in mind I have a couple of questions...

**Is the cirriculum of a DS masters relevant, or would the time be better invested into a Statistics / CS course?**

For example, the summary for Imperial reads ""Gain practical skills and experience in using industry-standard tools such as PySpark"", which makes it sound like it's an introductory course. I wouldn't sign up to a mathematics masters to ""gain experience solving differential equations"".

Does anybody here have recent experience from these degrees? Did you go into them having relevant experience already (such as the specialisations on Coursera or self-taught)? Has anybody done the course from Imperial (interested in that as I'm from the UK)?

**What alternatives are there?**

Either alternative course providers - I've heard of Georgia Tech but haven't investigated this much more, for example - or certificates. Are there any statistics courses you would recommend, or more rigorous online certificates that are extremely applicable to what you would do in your job as a data scientist?

**Background Information:**

TL;DR – I am looking into becoming a data analyst (or something similar), but I am starting from scratch.

I am a person in my mid-30s, and I am looking for a career change. I am currently working as an “Applications Engineer” using my BS degree in chemical engineering for the last 10 years… and no, not that kind of applications engineer.  In a general sense, I have been working as a ‘mechanical engineer’.  More specifically, I have been working in a customer-facing role where I develop customized proposals (bids) based on client specifications, technical details, budget considerations, and compliance with industry standards. I have worked in the oil/gas industry as well as the water/waste-water industry, with no experience in the tech field.

 

**Objective / Requirements:**

The short-term goal is to find a part-time, remote-based, position where I can leverage on-the-job experience into a full-time position. 

The end goal is to find a position making $150k+ per year, 100% remotely. 

 

**Problem Statement:**

**I am starting from scratch and don’t understand exactly what I “need” to learn.  All I can gather is that Excel, tableau, and SQL are common.  Does anyone know where I can take free online classes/courses that can help me learn these tools (or other applicable skill sets)?  What certificates, classes, etc. should I be taking to learn the basic tools for these positions or simple projects I can start to build a portfolio?**

I have seen various online courses that promise “$120k starting jobs in 6 months”, but cost between $3k and $15k.  However, these courses heavily focus on how they will help me; network, get my resume looked at, and optimize my LinkedIn without saying what ‘hard-skills’ I will be getting.  Honestly, they feel like high-pressure sales tactics to make me spend $10k for their “network”, with no real promise of a job at the end of it.  They all feel like scams to me.

I'm legitimately right now going to be doing nothing when I graduate. It's terrifying. Almost like my entire 4 years of university were a complete waste.

During my degree, I've taken courses in linear algebra, multivariate calculus, statistics (elementary, mathematical statistics, and stochastic modeling), and quite a few pertaining to machine learning algorithms. I did have a traditional CS undergraduate algorithms course, too. But I haven't been asked to code that much in most of my coursework, and so my coding is horrible. As well, I did not perform great in my algorithms course. I passed, but it was rough. My understanding of linear algebra is not good enough either. Many of these courses really just went in one ear and out the other because I only learned sufficient to pass the exams, and came away with poor understanding. If you asked me to teach a lecture for a Calc 1 course I could probably do it, though I'd need to prepare extensively so as to equip myself for the necessary rigor and questions I'd be asked, but Calc 2 and beyond? Forget it. Even an elementary LA course. I don't know what it to do, and it seems I'm pretty much screwed.

Data Science embedded in the business is very useful. Centralised data teams can lack the business understanding and they can be a big bottleneck, time-wose.

In such an environment advocated in strategic planing for budget (and title) to build out a data team and start structuring the data across the organization.

The center would get involved with things that have “legs,” in particular working with IT to make sure they are integrated into the data structure.",lxnkvie,datascience

This really determines your path forward. I have found that while ML models are in vogue, it is uphill battle to change workflows and processes of other departments.  So you may want to keep those Dashboard and report requests with DSs to ensure they get wins during the year and support these FTEs. 

Secondly, the “Field of Dreams” approach of build it and they will come, is a failed enterprise.  Business needs are identified outside the DS team by possibly your process experts. Define a real problem, then assign DS to see if a solution is feasible and how model outputs would be incorporated in processes. This solution may take phases for implementation.  I believe a lot of ML solutions are rushed to be deployed only to die due to low adoption and lack of understanding. 

Start with C-Suite goals and focus over next 2 years. Approach business experts to identify high value issues. Then brainstorm with DS team to rough-in ML approach to support specific outcomes and rough-in development, deployment and training plans. Develop team of key-stakeholders to support the project during development and post deployment. Determine KPIs to identify success.

# 1. Define Clear Goals with Business Impact

**Example**:  
Your team is asked to ""improve customer retention."" Break this into actionable objectives:

* Analyze churn patterns using historical data.
* Build a churn prediction model with 85% accuracy.
* Provide actionable recommendations, such as targeted discounts for at-risk customers.

Set clear deliverables and deadlines for each task. Align your team’s work with measurable business outcomes to demonstrate value.

# 2. Assign Projects Based on Strengths and Interests

**Example**:  
If one team member excels in deep learning while another is skilled in data visualization:

* Assign the deep learning expert to train a recommendation system.
* Let the visualization expert create dashboards to showcase insights to stakeholders.

Leveraging individual strengths ensures better quality work and keeps the team motivated.

# 3. Foster a Collaborative Environment

**Example**:  
Your team is working on a project to optimize a supply chain. Encourage collaboration by hosting brainstorming sessions.

* The data engineer can clean and preprocess data from multiple sources.
* The data scientists can experiment with predictive models.
* The junior team members can focus on feature engineering under guidance.

Collaboration ensures knowledge sharing and improves the quality of the solution.

# 4. Balance Technical and Business Communication

**Example**:  
Your stakeholder wants a complex predictive model explained. Guide your team to simplify the explanation:

* Avoid technical jargon like “gradient descent.”
* Instead, say: “We built a model that identifies patterns in customer behavior to predict future purchases, which can help you target marketing campaigns more effectively.”

Train your team to focus on the ""so what?"" factor for business relevance.

For instance, if a predictive model for logistics takes too long, suggest starting with rule-based heuristics as a temporary fix while the model is being fine-tuned.",lxqi6ve,datascience

My solutions: 
1. The big one was moving the excel files I needed to share point. Multiple people can work on the same file, so R can access it. If I need I could use power automate too.
2. Use R to copy and paste the file every time you need to use it. You may run into problems if you don’t have a certain package, maybe ‘rtools’? It needs more permissions as it accesses your file network, so this may not be possible. (You might have already tried this tbh.)
3. You can do some weird power automate code to copy the file every so often. I did this once because I couldn’t get around the rtools problem in R, but power automate can. It was just a simple code to copy the file to a new file every hour.

\- No one cares about how good your algorithm/ analysis was, bur what the business impact is.

Even a forecast (total guesstimate) is better.

It is way easier for me and my team to upskill you in technical aspects than it is in stakeholder management, requirements management, and other soft skills.

\- If you are to be hired as a DS/DA most of the time you will work with non technical stakeholders. I need to know that you will be able to operate in that environment.

If you get GLMs, you basically don't need anything else. I have not yet found a situation where a GLM isn't a good solution. It is almost always a ""more correct"" solution than t-tests/z-tests/chi-square/etc. too.

I've always wondered why stats courses start with t tests and chi squares, and typically almost never get to linear models. Or if they do, it's an afterthought.

This makes no sense to me. There are two reasons for my rationale here:

1. Most of the statistical tests you will use in your life are a special case of the linear model. If you understand how to apply GLMs, you very rarely need to know one of the many named tests -- you can just use a GLM and do valid inference.
2. Most of the named tests only apply in very narrow situations where you have designed your experiment carefully to ensure ""random"" assignment. Pretty much the only domain where this is given proper care is in clinical trials. If you haven't done this, there are probably 101 covariates that confound your result -- and if you don't make an effort to account for them (e.g. by using a GLM and including covariates as model terms) then you're going to come to wrong conclusions.",lwqn3yj,datascience

The business may not trust you to deliver or cater to their needs. To change this you need to act more like a consultant internally. 

One thing I often see is that analytics/it does not communicate well with the business. For example, at my current client the analytics team is invited to meetings with our stakeholders and doesn’t show up to the meetings. The stakeholders do and of course they feel like we are listening to them and delivering on their needs and notice that analytics/it is noticeably absent from these meetings. 

One way to quickly build credibility is to work with the consultants in delivery and take credit for their work. They are probably happy to have you do this. The more they can be seen as playing nice in the org the better for them. If things go wrong blame the consultants. It’s what we are there for. 

Along this same line I recently tried to give credit to the IT/analytics org and the refused to take it! In fact they were upset that I wanted to co-present at the sprint demo 😂. Once again who will the business see delivering? Us.

However, I see the masters as an opportunity for you to change tracks and modernize. If you focus your masters on ML/AI then you can come out of that potentially doing different work and more current topics.

What I see a lot happening right now in the field is a combination of ML and AI in agents and systems. So it’s not good enough to just go out and learn a GenAI or traditional ML. You definitely want both the LLMs and the machine learning fundamentals &amp; practice to put everything together into a system making recommendations or an agent capable of making autonomous decisions. 

So I’d either go to a masters in data science that allows you to take electives/track in AI unless you just want to change completely to computer science or something else.

Regarding the certifications, I’m a bit more pragmatic and I feel like having one of them is good just to show potential employers you know one cloud system as well as get past some of the bots- I would suggest either AWS or Azure and stay away from Google.

Trying to introduce more intelligence in how we forecast a key customer's demand for the primary purpose of staffing and capacity planning.

Background, we're a contract mnfr and have some 400 SKUs for this customer. Maybe a quarter of which make up the bulk of production hours.

I'd like to deliver max-high-avg-low-min demand scenarios. This means first generating demand qtys then pushing them through a tool to generate production hours - the second part is critical, obviously to literally get the hours but also because every SKU takes different time across different equipment, so seeing how varied demand can vary production hours is a huge benefit over current methods.

I was recently turned on to Monte Carlo simulations. From what I gather, firstly you simulate demand based on avg, stddev, maybe correlations or exact probabilities. Secondly, you sample from those simulations many times and draw conclusions based on those many samples. So if I want to forecast the next 3 months, I'd run 1000 simulations, then do 1000 samples and average them.

Why not average from the 1000 simulations themselves, no sampling? I can push all 1000 simulations through the production hours tool and rank them 1 to 1000 from lowest to highest total production hours. Then, for instance, average the hours from the top and bottom 20 simulations as the max and min; average sims let's say 750-850 as a high; average 150-250 as a low; and the average of all as the average (which should be basically the average of actuals over the same timeframe anyways).

You may be scoffing at this, and that's why I'm here, I want to understand the flaws.

Our customer's demand isn't that random month-to-month. The last 3 months will be a far better predicter of the next month, than 12 months prior. If I've already limited my average and std dev for generating the simulations to the last 3 months, aren't those simulations themselves a good range of predictions that I can just analyze and explain from?

Maybe, I guess, since I have in fact limited the inputs to 3 months, randomly sampling is basically the same? But so what's the statistical or scientific reason for the sampling, then? What am I missing.

Appreciate it in advance. Stepping into a new world here. I've got R now (haven't played with it since college) and I've got ambitious thoughts racing through my head, but I want to make reasoned and professionally defensible steps forward and not just chase random ideas.",lx4x037,datascience

I'm trying to get into data science/become a data scientist, but am a bit lost on the best way to get there - There's so much info and so many opinions out there it can get confusing and overwhelming, I could really use advice or guidance

**Where I'm at:**

* I've been working in data for about 4 years. I started as a data analyst where I mostly worked in Excel, had started doing some modelling (MMM) but not much, and had used Python briefly for preparing data.
* I started job hunting to move closer to data science and got a new job that promised that (advanced analytics, SQL &amp; python, and transitioning to data science/tist) however I haven't touched data once. I've mainly been doing BA work, data strategy stuff, and some project management. I did get to work with a guy briefly to build a dashboard using Python and Streamlit, but that's about it really. So I feel like I've really wasted my time at this company and have been strung along and moved further away from my goal.

**Where I want to be:**

* I want to move into a real data science role. I get that bc of the last 1-2 years I don't necessarily have the experience or skills for those roles and I am happy to move to a more analytical data analyst role or anything in between data analytics and data science. I'm starting to apply but think I could better use my time upskilling myself and building a portfolio and then applying seriously in the new year.

**What I need help:**

* Learning resources - there's so much out there I don't know what to focus on. What are the best courses or resources you'd recommend to get up to speed on the main data science skills? I can also do the Azure Data Scientist certificate through work - would that be helpful (in learning and job applications)? Are there any courses or certificates that have worked for you? Right now I'm doing a python BootCamp course as a refresher (I've done some computer science / programming courses at uni; python, SQL, c++)

I’m really into prediction markets and have a lot of experience with sports betting (Modeling/Bookmaking side of it). This summer, I had a trading operations internship at a quantitative trading firm this summer (One of: Citadel, Jane Street, SIG, or Optiver). I loved the focus on probabilistic thinking, and I want to pursue a career in something like Quant Trading, Sports Trading, or something involving hands on predictions and markets. I didn't really enjoy the operations work so I turned down the return offer so I am currently also applying for jobs.

* Tuition: $53,000
* Credits: 30
* Pros: Really good brand recognition, Has best selection of classes 
* Cons:  Most Expensive one by good margin and it will be my first time taking out a loan, Have heard mixed reviews of how much Data Science degree holds in job market 
* [Courses/Curriculum](https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/data-science/courses/)

I graduated over a year ago with a masters degree in meteorology. Unfortunately the job market for meteorologists isn't the most inspiring and it has been a real uphill battle to try and find a suitable role. In the meantime I've had the chance to work on roles which are basically data scientist positions with an emphasis on meteorological applications. In both cases these ended up having to deal with NN models in PyTorch. My current role lasts till the end of the year and unfortunately since it was sort of a research based role on a project that is also wrapping up, I have to look for other opportunities.

Given that I feel that another data scientist position may be what is more feasible for me in the current market, I wanted to try and improve my skills and CV so that I can be better suited for more data science roles. Currently I obtained the jobs I got because my meteorology background was a prerequisite for the job but data science with a focus on meteorology isn't a very expansive field so I feel I need to do more so I can be a suitable candidate for other data science positions as well.

As someone with a scientific background (my undergrad degree was in physics as well), a LOT of my experience tends to lie primarily in Python. I feel I am a competent coder (nothing too special though). I have some brief experience with R from my time in university but no SQL I'm reasonably comfortable with machine learning having worked with different NN's including ANN's, CNN's, LSTM's etc as well as dabbling a bit with SVR and RF but have zero experience on the database side of things. Also zero experience with the cloud computing side of things which I've seen come up in plenty of applications as well.

Basically, what are the areas I can focus on improving/trying to add experience in so as to be a better candidate for more general data science positions and what are some good resources to go about doing so?",lwyjll6,datascience

For example, my current company pays me $2800 per month, which is just okay by local standards.

To make things worse, my contract ends in January, so I’m actively job hunting. I received an offer from a company that, while appealing in most aspects, offers a lower salary than my current one. I’m debating whether to reject the offer or take it and supplement my income with freelance work.

You might wonder why I’m not working for an international company. The thing is, my English isn’t great, and I’m not yet fluent in conversations. I know I need to work on that, so I'm looking for a job where I can work with at least one foreign client.",lwwfvfd,datascience

I would like to get as proficient as possible in applied data science/CS prior to graduation. My end goal is to work in neuroscience research, but any data science job will do for now.

The course series and descriptions are as follows: 

1. a) Linear optimization: The optimization of linear functions subject to linear constraints. Linear programming, duality theory, sensitivity analysis, applications.

b) Nonlinear optimization: Nonlinear optimization with emphasis on basic theory (including Lagrange multipliers and the Kuhn-Tucker conditions), algorithms for numerical solution of problems, and applications. Introductory dynamic programming, with emphasis on applications and algorithms.

OR

2. a) Numerical computation: Computer arithmetic, solution of nonlinear equations and optimization in a single variable; matrix factorization; matrix iterative techniques.

b) Numerical analysis: Polynomial interpolation including splines, orthogonal systems of functions and least squares approximation; numerical differentiation and integration; solution of systems of nonlinear equations and unconstrained optimization.

Computation is a prerequisite for analysis. I could take linear optimization and computation instead of one of the series as well.

I have no coding experience but I'm interested in automating a daytrading strategy. I manually daytrade and have a rough concept/starting point for what I want to automate. I think it has some promise but I want to run some analysis on various data points in hopes of optimizing entry points and avoiding poor entries or 'fakeouts'. 

Basically hoping the analysis can pick up on certain patterns or data points that tend to appear often for failed/unsuccessful trades (stopped out) and successful ones. I'd like to export a bunch of my chart data, order flow data and other values I tend to look at for trading and use a program like KNIME to analyze it and pick up on patterns and tendencies associated with those successful and unsuccessful trades.


Given what I just explained... are there any particular concepts I should explore or learn more about to help with accomplishing this? Am I right to start looking into KNIME's data science free course they have? It appears they eventually get into teaching me about ""time series analysis"" which would seem relevant to daytrading from what I can tell.

I am a current chemical engineer working on a Master's in Data Analytics at my local university (Utah State). The time has come to register for my final elective, and I can't decide between these two:

\- **Data Pipeline Engineering:** From the data analytics department. ""This course explores the design and engineering of effectively structured data ecosystems. Using programming tools, students develop efficient and effective dataflows to ensure quality data are available to meet critical data analysis requirements.""  
\- **Introduction to Probability:** From the math department. ""Students study discrete and continuous probability, random variables, the distribution and density function, joint distributions, conditional probabilities and expectations, Bayes' theorem, moments, moment generating functions, inequalities, convergence in probability and distribution, and central limit theorem""

Additional background: my program has mostly been very applied. There has not been much theory so far, and after the upcoming semester all I have left is my capstone project (i.e. thesis). I will also be taking a required statistics course, Statistical Learning and Data Mining I, that will be more theoretical than most of my past classes, focusing more on the theory of the machine learning algorithms and techniques I have already applied in other classes. Even though I'm an engineer, I don't feel I have a particularly strong background in statistics (and I'm rusty anyway), especially if I want to be more data science (rather than business analytics) focused, but I can also see how data pipeline engineering could be a very useful class, especially to apply in the field I'm already working in.

- try other scalers
- try double scaling lol
- augmentations and resampling, synthetic data
- evaluate different metrics. There are many with imbalance in mind
- collect more data, esp. Minority
- consider a ""maybe"" label (ternary classification)
- feature selection, dimensionality reduction, examine collinearity
- cleaner data
- enhance with outside data sources; consider pretraining
- bigger cross validation
- see if you can collect different signals or more relevant features
- audit the data collection and ingestion processes
- try different seeds lol
- remove outliers
- try an anomaly detection paradigm
- I was toying with the idea of inlier selection with ransac for individual trees the other day
- see what an automl library comes up with; maybe you'll get some ideas
- iterate more in feature engineering
- experiment with different categorical encodings
- see if you can improve the whole pipeline somehow
- can you make your model significantly faster than what's in production w/o sacrificing too much? If it can't predict faster or with less memory, can we retrain faster?
- can we look at drift detection and redeployment strategies?
- deal with missing data
- think about hardware
- take a look at cluster analysis. Maybe identify niches and train different models for them
- maybe look at where the heuristic model tends to fail and identify or detect those conditions so you could only run inference when the label isn't 'obvious' heuristically
- see if there are better ways of serving your model. If it's more expensive than the heuristics, maybe only serve it on off-peak hours or whenever it could have the best business impact
- question the business case to make sure you aren't solving a non-problem
- examine column dtypes. You can go lighter and faster with appropriate downcasts or maybe you notice you sacrificed too much precision or something
- if you can't improve the results themselves, maybe polish the presentation of your results
- try dimensionality reduction on subsets, like maybe the least important features
- update your dependencies
- calibration
- compare results to a RF on your top 3 features (instead of a dummy stump)
- ask a mentor or colleague for advice/ideas/insight/code review
- hand-label a few samples to get 'psychologically closer' to your data
- stratify your splits
- consider additional stratification by an important categorical or binned continuous
- consider what other useful business insights are in your data. Maybe your model can actually be a multi label classifier, which might justify the increased cost

You don't have the original inputs nor the embedding algorithm.

I don't think that it is possible to get the original inputs because embedding algorithms are (almost in 100% of cases) not loss-less. Here's a very crude proof (please excuse me, it has been a long time):

- Suppose there is a non-lossless embedding algorithm that maps a set of inputs I to a set of embeddings E.
- Since this is a non-lossless embedding, the number of elements in I is strictly greater than the number of elements in E.
- Therefore, there exists at least one element e (in E) that is mapped to by i1 and i2 (in I).
- So, given e, we cannot guarantee the original input.*

Real example:

- We have an embedding algorithm that outputs a vector of size 2 that counts the number of occurrences of the word ""dog"" and ""cat"" in the input.
- For some embedding vector e = {1, 1}, can we obtain the original sentence?
- No, there are an infinite number of inputs that could have resulted in e. ""I have a dog and a cat"". ""The dog chased the cat"". ""The cat chased the dog"".

*The only reason why this works for an encoder-decoder network is that we have the context trained and learned by the model to get back close to the original input. If we have a lossless embedding, then this falls closer to the realm of cryptography.

While you probably can't extract the exact inputs out from the embeddings, you can do things like cluster analysis, vector analysis (e.g., TF-IDF for word embeddings), etc. in order to get a general understanding of the original data - but you definitely cannot reproduce the original input exactly.",lwd8vtb,datascience

**Google Flu Trends model**

During the early 2000’s, Google attempted to track and predict flu cases by linking keyword searches to areas of flu cases. While it initially worked well, the model was purely based on correlations between keywords and flu outbreaks with no regard for sound theory. As a result, the model ended up overestimating flu cases during outbreaks, compared to what the CDC data indicated, and underestimating cases during non-seasonal outbreaks. I think the Google Flu Trends model is a good example of the “Big Data Hubris” and the need for proper data collection and theory to inform hypotheses.



**1936 Literary Digest Poll**

The Literary Digest was a respected publication at the time, having correctly called many prior elections. After receiving about 2.4 million postal opinions from its readership, it confidently predicted Landon winning when Roosevelt actually ended up winning by a landslide. Unsurprisingly, TLD isn’t around today. Explanations for TLD’s missteps centered on selection biases in its readership survey: its audience were mainly wealthier people who didn’t accurately represent the population and were more likely to favour the republican candidate. So why did it mainly end up with rich people in its survey? Because it mainly reached out to people who owned telephones and automobiles - both relative luxuries at the time. A good example of sampling bias. 



**Vietnam body count metric**

This case study is a prime example of how using a metric with poor internal validity can lead to poor outcomes. The US Secretary of Defence at the time, Robert McNamara, was enthusiastic about using data analysis to measure the progress of the war. However, relying on enemy body count itself as a primary metric was extremely unreliable since those counts could be inflated and there wasn’t always a good criteria for establishing who could be correctly counted as a combatant. We all know how the Vietnam War went down. This case study may provide lessons on the need for carefully constructing KPIs, and how politics can render metrics ineffective. 



**1986 Challenger disaster**

I remembered this story during a class on logistic regression. After numerous setbacks and delays, the decision makers were under pressure to launch in less than ideal conditions despite reservations about safety. The shuttle exploded a little over a minute, killing all 7 crew. The reason? The O-rings responsible for sealing within the booster joints became deformed owing to the cold weather. NASA made the decision to launch based on an incomplete picture where they discounted launches conducted in colder weather, which also had a higher probability of failure. Why? Because they assumed that those launches weren’t relevant. This is one of the more harrowing examples where a critical analysis of assumptions and complete data would be the difference between life and death.",lw6w69v,datascience

I like to start with some of the studies that show that even if you have the same dataset, analysts will draw different conclusions (e.g. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597821000200)

I think this is important. I rarely find people admitting that the analytical approach they take will affect the conclusions. Since you work with observational data, the number of fallacies and approaches you can take will increase. Which affects the conclusions and recommendations. Not many want to do something that doesn't move the needle in the right direction. Which is the result of acting on wrongful conclusions. So it's important that people can recognize fallacies and issues.

Honestly? Find a new employer.

Meeting culture is real. I’ve worked at places in big tech (FAANG) at which it was a badge of honor to have a full calendar. “Oh, you think you’re busy? Look at my calendar!” That’s bullshit. If you can’t get quality work done in 40hrs because 30 hrs was taken up by meetings and 4 hours was taken up by “code switching” from meetings to getting back into work mode, you’ll always be behind and your employers will keep pushing and pushing for more of your time at the same pay rate. 

Bullshit to that, I say.

I recently took a Sr. DS gig at a smaller, non-FAANG, non-tech company (but with an excellent salary)  and the culture is not “stack your calendar with meetings.” The culture is “do good work amd talk to people when you need to.” It’s refreshing to be able to focus and do quality work instead of bouncing from call to call, unable to focus. It marvelous, really.

Culture differences at companies exist and finding the right fit can be tough. I’ve been around enough to know what I like and what I don’t, and I’m unwilling to work for one of those “busy with meetings because that’s the expectation” places again.

ETA: if you can’t leave for a new gig, talk to your boss. Be protective of your time. Have some blockers that give you time to focus. Before I left FAANG, I carved out 3 hrs each day for my own personal focus time. The rest of my time was open for booking. If it was booked that day, okay. If not booked the day before, I’d work to manage the rest of my calendar to keep meetings in a block so I could have more focus time.",lvwjfxf,datascience

A lot of people do it to get a raise or keep up with inflation. As long as you're moving up in title, skill set, and you have added value, then it's okay! I’ve never had anyone ask me why in an interview and I’ve believed if you’re not earning and learning, it’s time to leave. You’re doing yourself a disservice staying if the only reason is you don’t want to appear to be job hopping. That doesn't mean some companies don't see it as a red flag, though.

 
Advances in Big data, ML, or AI can be hard to keep up with if you stay at the same company for too long. Avoiding that is why I mention JID! JID is a smart tech career tool that highlights professional growth. Developers make their detailed profiles and employers then directly approach them. It’s anonymous until the candidate decides otherwise, making it perfect for browsing or introspecting in your tech journey. I use it and think it would be perfect for you too! Another ""trick"" is Echotalent AI. Because it personalizes your resume to the ""tech lingo"" used by your future employer, having many multiple jobs become almost advantageous!",lvuk5al,datascience

The problem is that businesses want somebody already experienced with the whole fleet of specific off-the-shelf software they already use, rather than somebody who can come up to speed and roll with the punches as requirements inevitably change.

only conversation, is a russian roulette

For example, if it takes more than a day to build a new environment, you'll never get there 😉

You're 'the only person doing DevOps' and your managers feel that systems need to be 'monitored' for changes to config/services. Now, keep in mind that your managers may not be technically inclined, and they may very well be asking for the wrong thing 😉

However, going from experience, if they're asking you this, it is because of a desire to be 'more in control' of what happens on these systems. The objective: make change predictable, and improve availability/stability. Which is a great objective to have, but not something I'd solve with any kind of 'monitoring' solution. Check with your manager what they are trying to achieve, and whether it is what I'm suggesting here. This will also help you not waste a crap ton of time on something that \_will\_ monitor VMs for changes, but will do nothing to prevent or correct the resulting outage.

So how to navigate this? Well, we could go through a complete re-architecture of everything, and other commenters have already taken a head start in that direction. But if this thread is starting out because you're looking for help in implementing your managers' suggestion for 'monitoring', I don't think changing architectures is within your mandate.

Instead, we have 50+ VMs that we currently consider 'uncontrolled' environments. And we would like to change that. In order to get something that both works, keeps working, \_and\_ doesn't blow up other things in the landscape, you need to figure out a few things:

1. Who owns these VMs? This seems like a simple question, but it might not be. Is your team (or you, as the DevOps person) creating and managing these VMs? Is there another (infra/OS) team involved that manages 'the base system'? If it's just your team, that's great, because you're not potentially going to break someone else's stuff at some point 😉 If there \_is\_ an infra/OS team managing stuff, start by having a chat with them. They may have things in place (e.g. Ansible or Puppet) that you can leverage.
2. How are changes to 'your VMs' made, and who is making the changes? Let's figure out how the current situation works. Ask your team, if necessary perform some archeology. Are developers logging into systems and manually changing things? Is there deployment tooling (like XL Deploy or RunDeck) performing changes? Etcetera. Getting 'in control' will eventually mean 'controlling how things are changed'. Knowing your stakeholders/target audience and the current way of working will help you not just in coming up with a solution, but also in making sure your solution gets a 'graceful landing' in your organization. This is absolutely key if your solution also involves 'taking root permissions away from people' 😉
3. What is the level of capability in your team? You may come up with an amazing solution, but if nobody knows how to use it or gets frustrated with it, you have just become a single point of failure. Best case it means 'infinite job security', worst case it means burnout or people simply working around your solution. Also leverage your managers if you find that your team is reluctant or unable to adopt automation for system config changes (it happens, a lot). In the end your managers (probably) want to achieve 'being in control' of the environments, and automation is by far the best solution for it. If your team lacks knowledge to do so, management can arrange for proper training. If your team doesn't want to use automation, management can offer the alternative (which is basically 'death by processes' 😛 ). Politics or knowledge management aren't yours to deal with, use your managers for that.

Now in terms of tech, let's look at options; not architecture. I would \_always\_ pick immutable infrastructure in 2024, but that's not what you have. So what you're looking for is a means of managing the desired state of long-lived, mutable systems, as code. A.k.a. Configuration Management Tooling. Over the past 2 decades there have been many successful solutions for this purpose. Today, Ansible probably has the most traction, although its propensity to become 'dirty Bash scripts wrapped in YAML' is something I dislike about it. But it does get the job done, and it's \_very\_ actively being backed by IBM/RedHat to the point of them applying it as the solution for everything.

Another solution I've used quite a bit (but over a decade ago -- even though it still exists today) is Puppet. Puppet ticks all the boxes in the sense that it's not just a solid solution for Config Management (or 'desired state as code') with the option of storing that code in Git, and moving back to previous versions, etc; but it also offers options for quickly gathering intel across your environment (e.g. 'which VMs run an OpenSSL version lower than X?'), or monitoring changes. The ability to quickly 'query our environment' proved helpful quite often; especially when management would panic over some vulnerability they read about on the internet 😉 We used to have dashboards (for management) and alerts (for us) to keep track of issues or illegal changes.

But whichever tech solution you choose, make sure to go through steps 1 to 3 first, so you don't end up breaking another team's work, your own team's work, or building someone that your peers can't effectively use.",lyyhmkx,devops

* https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/

&gt;We pretty quickly ran into issues like me needing to deploy something to prod, but the commits from the other dev would be included as well, but his wasn't approved/tested yet.

This breaks the golden rule of trunk based development (TBD) that you never commit code to the main branch that breaks the integration tests.

In your situation, the scaled variant of TBD might work better for you, where the incomplete work of another developer sits on a short-lived feature branch (see doc above ""Scaled Trunk Based Development""). Tools like Github Actions and Jenkins can integrated into Github PR workflows to prevent untested code being merged to main branch. You can also add merge approvals. This complex overhead is more typical of larger teams sharing a common codebase.

&gt;Again we have dev, test and prod. But dev is equal to prod. So you start branch from dev, do your stuff, merge into test. When it's tested merge into prod and dev and close the branch.

Now, let's address environments. If you stand back from Git, what do you use environments for? To run different *versions* of your code at the same time. For example:

* **Integration (Dev)**: runs the latest code built from ""main"" branch.
* **Test**:  runs the latest release: 1.24.0
* **Production**: runs the release last approved by test: 1.23.4

So, what is a release? Instead of branches in Git, think of release management as a conveyer belt in a factory. The ""release"" is a thing created in development and passed to test as a candidate for production. Only the good releases are approved and passed onto production. (Test might find a problem and demand a new patched version of the code). Releases are a linear progression of your code's capabilities. Branching is a dev construct to facilitate parallel work.

So, ideally, a ""release"" should be something created from the source code. This explains why we use tags in git to pin the source code at a point in time. This pinned code is then used to build file(s) that are used for deployment to a target environment.
For example:  

* Docker image + Helm chart, stored in a Docker registry.
* Java war file, stored in Artifactory
* Compressed tarball (myapp-1.24.0.tar.gz), stored in a shared directory 😀

Lastly, if you reject this packaging nonsense and just want to deploy directly from Git, then do this deployment from tags (fixed snapshot of your code in time), not branches.

Merge conflicts and tasks are dealt with by pure communication as it’s a small team. Alternatively, devs can push their branches to remote for a review and raise PRs. They are short-lived and removed after they rebased (again, not merged). Then, releases happen with tags. Whenever the release is approved, a certain commit gets a tag (like 0.0.2) and this release is built (a container, or binary or whatever). Also, the very latest commit gets its own release (not a prod one) just to reflect the current fresh “nightly” version of the software. It might be breaking.

Having prod as main and only merging code that's ready for prod is usually the best way to always know what's in prod.

Someone asks you what's deployed, it's always the main branch.

Another option is making tags off of main with the code bundle you want if you're worried about an errant push to main. But generally if something got to main it should have passed all relevant tests.

Branches IMO are more for dev'ing. Make a branch and push code, automatic testing/linters fire right away and see what's bad. Fix issues, dev is good with code, they try to merge the CL but you have more automated tests gating that merge to main. If it passes it's good to go.

As the other poster pointed out, when it comes to freelancing, it generally helps to think like a client and ask yourself what kind of scenario would someone pay cash money for someone with your skillset and experience level to come in on a temporary basis.

The reality is, no-one is going to pay for a raw grad with next to zero experience on a Freelancing basis for DevOps. It doesn't make sense.

Freelancing is really something you do once you have a lot of experience and a solid network built up over time, and DevOps itself trends towards senior positions where its generally expected you were an accomplished software or infra engineer prior to this. It's also a position of trust and requires quite invasive access, so its normally harder to come in as a DevOps freelancer then it is a front end dev etc.

Your best bet is to get a full time job first and start banking the experience. You're currently trying to do things backwards.

To answer your bullets:

1. Personal network. People knew what my track record and specialisms were, so they'd ask.
2. Track record of deliveries and leadership experience.
3. There isn't such a thing that is both high demand and 'beginner friendly'. They tend to be mutually exclusive - roles with stuff that's easy isn't normally hard to fill by definition.

The best thing you can do in terms of marketing, is locate yourself where the customers are at, and make some waves. For example, find an area with big tech meetups, and e-mail the organizers asking them to present this or that hot subject. If you can find a similar way to do it online, do that. Marketing is all about getting the product (you) in front of the customers, who can then decide they want to pay for it.

As a techie, you should first find demand, then create the technical solution. If you find a big community/meetup/whatever of potential customers interested in Kubernetes, do that. If you find cloud instead, do that. If you find some niche tool, do that. Over the years, the topics change, so learn new things all the time and promote/market them.

Before I started freelancing, I learned Perforce and got a job at that, then was hobby-learning Git and Atlassian products, so a job found me for doing that (circa 2009). Later, when I started freelancing, I was doing Puppet, then Chef, then AWS, then Jenkins, and some Atlassian products like JIRA and Bamboo. All this time was organizing a huge meetup group and constantly presenting things myself as well. Then ramped up the consultancy to about 10 employees who were doing all of the above. Then Docker became popular, we were actually one of the biggest meetup for Docker. Kubernetes came along, so we started doing that.

  
**Update:** don't listen to the nay-sayers who tell you shouldn't be doing it with so little experience. Just go for it. In order to get experience, you got to experience stuff. There is no way to get it without being in the midst of it all. Sure, your first customer will not treat you like the architect almighty, they might give you some shitty yaml-config-writing task, but it is exactly the kind of thing you want to be doing to get the experience.

\&gt; This should only be used for load balancer implementations that route traffic directly to pods as opposed to using node ports.

Imagine the load balancer can route network traffic directly to the pods. And that something (can be e.g. a controller or a script) configures the load balancer with the IPs of three pods handling the service, as well as the ports on which the service actually listens within the container in the pod. Then the load balancer forwards incoming traffic to one of the healthy PodIP/ContainerPort endpoints.

The key part is network reachability. Your network design must ensure that - for example in AWS VPC with VPC CIDR 2001:db8:dead:be00::/56, your EKS workers will receive /80 subnets, for example:

\- worker1 2001:db8:dead:be01:2387::/80 (VPC subnet1)

\- worker2 2001:db8:dead:be02:4311::/80 (VPC subnet2)

\- worker3 2001:db8:dead:be03:7018::/80 (VPC subnet3)

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-increase-ip-addresses.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cni-increase-ip-addresses.html)

A 3-pod service deployed to all three workers may be assigned 2001:db8:dead:be01:2387::2, 2001:db8:dead:be02:4311::6, 2001:db8:dead:be03:7018::a. The service listens on port 80 and 443 (let's say it's an ingress-nginx).

The AWS load balancer controller registers these three addresses as load balancer targets.

On Incoming traffic, the LB chooses one of the three targets and forwards all the traffic directly to those IPs/ports, e.g. \[2001:db8:dead:be03:7018::a\]:443 for HTTPS. Nginx responds and the network handles the routing of traffic back to the LB and/or client.

Forwarding the traffic back is where the load balancer implementations may differ - you may or may not see client's IP (=the IP in the internet) in the pod/container, or you may not. But it's the network responsibility to handle the return traffic (and AWS sometimes fails with that, unless you disable Client IP preservation).

Load balancers that work in the Direct server return mode \[https://www.haproxy.com/glossary/what-is-direct-server-return-dsr\] (e.g. Cilium) will make sure that the return traffic is direct - from the pods to the router directly. Load balancers that work in the (destination) NAT mode \[https://www.haproxy.com/blog/layer-4-load-balancing-nat-mode\] will just replace the destination LB VIP with the actual pod IP, but you should route all the traffic back to the balancer so that it can perform the reverse translation, while handling the rest of the NAT quirks.",lypvycs,devops

Load balancers can send traffic directly to pod IPs if network routes exist (either instructing them send traffic to the node first in which case the Linux kernel handles routing or sending directly to pod IP if pods are on the same network as the LB)

For instance, let's say your home network is 192.168.0.0/24. You have a k8s node 192.168.0.1 and a client machine 192.168.0.2. Your k8s pod network cidr is 192.168.200.0/24. You can add a static route on your client machine 192.168.200.0/24 via 192.168.0.1 and now you can connect directly to pods--same works with load balancers.

Really when you use NodePort, all nodes listen to the NodePort even if they don't have a pod. When traffic arrives at the NodePort, the k8s node rewrites the address to a pod's IP/port (which could be on the same or different node). Effectively NodePort makes the k8s nodes act like a load balancer.",lyt0br9,devops

On your... personal preference.  

As long as you CAN code, be it in scripting with Python (which I often take as a bare minimum), you'll be OK.

You need to be able to automate things to be effective. 

As for feature development... It depends on how you run your platform systems. I'd typically run them with a proper SDLC, versioning, features, testing etc.

As for ""sprints"" and ""crunch""... This isn't DevOps. And SRE is one of many engineering functions of a DevOps workplace.

This is why I loathe the title ""DevOps"" ... It makes people believe that DevOps is purely an engineering problem. 

It isn't.

It is about leadership and process, which leads to business transformation.

I don't do anything related to business development, still. Only tools and stuff.

I'm saying this because when I felt in the same situation, I gave a day to each tool I tested that could allow to manage a fleet of servers : salt, chef, puppet, and ansible.  
The objectives were to be able to sync a directory of scripts, send ssh keys and manage the updates of the systems, or a least a report.  
With as little of development knowledge as possible, as this is not something you find easily in other sysops fellows, a low bar must be acknowledged.  

With less than a day to each of them, I wasn't even far, or find that they required too much of real code in the declarations to have something working.  
  
Aside Ansible : with it, I had everything I was looking for, and was already started on more complicated stuff before the end of the day.  
Knowing how to code helped, but its structure felt easier for people not much accustomed to development.  
And when something is not available as a build-in task, there is always the cmd/shell tasks to execute bash commands.  
  
Plus, no agent required, but still need to create a dedicated user (please, no root user with ssh).  
  

Still, some majors limitations :  

* like every tool, there is a learning curve. Whatever the choice, it will be steep at some times because having to manipulate stuff deep in the system and the initial data is not enough or with a not easily usable structure.  
* you cannot automate if each thing you want to manage must be done as a unique case. Consistency and standardization are the keys, there is no way around this.  
* it will take time to cover everything you need, so one step at a time.  

---
**For what you are seeking :** 

1- ansible has the possibility of adhoc commands.  
Meaning you just launch a single (or chain of ) commands on all targeted servers, and get immediately the result in the ouput.  
An example to execute the ""free"" command on some servers would be : `ansible --inventory /path/to/all/servers/conf  -m shell -a ""free -h""  server1:serv2:group_serv:srv5`  
A useful parameter, depending of what is executed : `--one-line` which will present the output in a single line per server  
  
---
2- Ansible execute its command in parallel between the targeted servers, but waiting for them at each task. The output is printed on the controller in the stdout. Either a single status, or more detailed if the --diff parameter was activated.  
For the commands themselves, either adhoc commands for simple tasks, or create/reuse roles through playbooks.  
A task is a single action, like shell, but also applying a template to a config file, copying files, ...  
A role is a bunch of task used for a common theme (updating, or deploying the application xyz, managing users, ...). This said, the ""theme"" of a role is arbitrary.  
Playbooks are the link between the list of servers and their parameters (also called inventory) and what you want to execute on them : you specify which hosts or group of hosts, and the roles or tasks, and their order.  
  
Also, any task can be registered to a variable, then printed usually on the stdout, or used to populate a file if desired.  
  
---
3- Ansible itself is a command line utility at heart. You can get a look to ansible AWX for the UI part.  
But there will be no ""easy"" stuff as everything will need to be implemented first (or reusing existing roles).  
Only then, you will be able to get in the UI, change the content of a file (a ssh key for example), then launch the related playbook and come back 5 mins later or check the mails to validate there was no error.  
  
---
**Some stuff that could help :**  

* ansible connect to the servers using ssh, it has no agent. A lot of parameters are available to access other servers through a jumbox/bastion/relay, altered port or anything else.  
If it is supported by ssh, there is a way to have it with ansible.  

* Do yourself a favor and activate the logging output to a file asap : ansible.cfg =&gt; log_path  
  It is helpfull to review or check what happened. 

* create yourself a test environment with some throwable VM before running something on production.  

* everything is ran from a single server, the ansible controller. You can have multiple of them as long as there is no overlapping of the servers they manage.  
  I usually ran one for the non-prod, and a second for the production. Plus my own testbed.  
  You can have multiple inventories, also.  

* centralize the roles and the inventory on git. In case of a doubt, the /etc/ansible/ directory of an ansible controller must be able to be fully cleared and filled in few commands.  

* the most important : planning and creating the inventory (or inventories).  
  You will have to list the servers, and place them into groups, be it for the systems, the versions, what is installed on them, how to connect to, ...  
  The reason is that a server can have its own settings, but a group (of server) can also contains settings for all its members. That's when it become more powerful, as any new server only have to be inserted in the desired groups, nothing more.  
  Basically you will end with multiple set of groups, one set for the technical information, another one for the applications, another set for the type : dev, staging, ..., prod, and so on.   
  Of course, prepare backups.    

---
And throwing some useful parameters to the ansible-playbook command :  

* --diff : aside the shell commands, all tasks can print their changes applied on the servers (file or directory creation, owner, mode, content of an altered file, ...)  
  Extremely helpful when applying changes for the first time.  
* --limit : a playbook will target usually one or multiple group of servers, limit can restrict to a single server if desired, other will be skipped.  
* --tag : same as limit, but for tasks or role, to execute only some parts on the servers. It is worth noting the tags can be declared only in the section of a playbook, they will apply to the tasks and roles of said section.",lynp26x,devops

I totally agree with your concern about Grafana's separation of observability data storage into three components, which complicates deployment and management without improving effectiveness. That's why we developed GreptimeDB ( [https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb) ), an all-in-one solution for observability data, including metrics, logging, and tracing (via OpenTelemetry).

You gain a overview of the information(it may fill holes lightly), but it doesn't give you good working patterns which you would gain from experience.  Certs do affect hiring, companies esp consultancies do hire based on this as they can get contracts based on number of certified engineers.

Will it greatly enhance you're knowledge? maybe, I would briefly run through the training at a lesser cost and then I would get hands on experience attempting to implement what you learned.  This is most impactful to gaining skill.  I wouldn't get the cert unless you planned on working for a consultancy that gets contracts based on marketing aggregated cert numbers of the employees they employ.

* https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/databases

The idea is that the vault generates a temporary leased credential, given a certain role, to access the database. Since each credential has a time to live (TTL), it naturally takes care of all the usual problems associated with password revocation and rotation. 
Vault has an API that can be used to extend the lease on an issued credential, and for production, this feature can be used by your application's connection pool. 

Sadly, this approach tends to scare developers and DBAs 😔
The more conservative approach is to integrate the database with an Enterprise SSO solution.
Sadly, this is not universally available and does not address credential rotation for service accounts... (oh no, did I let the cat out of bag? 😉)

Hope this helps

Coincidentally found this project today, which might simplify the use of dynamic database credentials on Kubernetes.

We use python and powershell exclusively to build tools for my team to manage the environment. For example, our change management system, my team wrote that in house and we maintain it.

Long version:

As few answered before me. DevOps (and Platform Engineering even more) is about writing code to achieve automation.

Problem is to write good code and build good scalables system out of it (yes platform, IaC and CI/CD pipelines are systems) you have to understand principals of software architecture. Same story goes for QAs. Great testing automation engineer are just great engineers and architects.


Of course you can brute force your way in. And iterate on that, but based on my experience (personal and other folks who moved from fullstacks to devops) it is significantly easier especially your team works on new tools and want to use latest and greatest.

For me as a full stack (7 years as fullstack dev + 3 in devops) all those tools like terraform, pulumi, crossplane, argo, etc. is just new framework/language.

I can pick whatever does the best job in specific scenario, if non of the above I can fall back and write java microservice or typescript browser automation with playwright that will do the job. Concepts are the same. Specific stack is just translation to specific language with nuances like grammar and semantics.

This also means that teaching someone with dev background cloud and ops things is significantly easier than the other way around.

At some point I worked with decent java dev (3 years of experience at the time) in my team. He had no background with kubernetes, kafka or cloud. He was tasked to write tools to backup messages from kafka topic to s3 for specific offset(doesn't matter why (yes of course it was compliance related) but so you just understand the complexity of the task). He did that in 5 days with full support for EKS IRSA. 2 days of understanding api that he had to interact with (cron jobs, s3, s3 iam, kafka), 2 days for code (including helm chart) and 1 day for tests and polishing. And code was robust as his performance testing set was 1 million messages to assure decent memory usage and reasonable times.

Good luck doing something like that with team of people who can only write bash scripts.",ly5aooa,devops

If you have experience in C (php, python), Java, Ruby or nodejs then that should be enough to get a role. Some may be more specific about a language.

I’ve been working as a Frontend Developer (2.5 years, EU) but found that I don’t enjoy it as much anymore. However, I’ve had the chance to work on Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD tasks, which I found fascinating despite some challenges (networking, for example).

I’ve been learning Docker and Kubernetes in my free time and now aspire to become a DevOps Engineer. However, I’ve heard it’s rare to transition directly from Frontend to DevOps, and I’m feeling stuck on how to proceed.

Would it be better to:

1. Build my own projects to gain hands-on experience?
2. Focus on one cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
3. Learn backend first before moving into DevOps?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",ly86ilm,devops

Startup? You're probably in between a PE and Developer. Might even be doing CE work depending on who they are willing to give shares to. 

SMB? You're probably wearing at the very least a Platform Engineer and DevOps hat. You're probably doing CE work on top, but probably badly (without any fault of your own).

Consultant? You're probably a Cloud Engineer who dabbles at the very least as a PE. If you have a programming background, you're making bank as you find/can fix all the issues from the bottom of the stack (app config) to the top (monitoring/observability).

Junior - Take this 9k line json file with 12 elements per item and print the same three fields for each item.

Senior - Parse a 9k lines of json from the output of an API and feed the relevant variables into each type of alert in whatever the internal alerting platform is.

Eg, if the API reports all the statuses for 3k servers with a couple dozen stats for each, you don't want to feed all that data into an alerting platform wholesale, you want to feed just the bits it needs for a particular alert.

I was confused recently when a DevOps engineer said we couldn't do something with Kubernetes because ""Kubernetes doesn't support that"". First, I was like... this is free-and-open-source software, why can't we simply add the feature we wanted and then upstream it? But then, I went reading the code and found that this feature _is supported already_, but behind some sort of alpha flag. Because they don't code much, and seem to avoid diving into the underlying code, they just had to throw their hands up with a ""it says in the docs you can't do that"", when in reality we were entirely able to do the thing trivially and saved ourselves a ton of time and effort.

I wrote a volcanically scathing review when it first released, and now consider it a masterpiece of sorts.

It’s like a book that draws you in and feels weird, and you’re not sure if you like it. But, if you relax into and accept it, it’s just magical.

You upgrade your character, ships, equipment, structures, buildings, vehicles.

Acquire any of many different types of ships. Customize them for fighting or commerce or travel. Find and fix them, build a fleet.

Jump systems. Fly through them and look for special resources or different planet types or structures. Scan everything, endlessly, but get paid for it. Take missions to do a variety of things.

Get trapped on planets. Panic and die to low oxygen or acid rain or creepy enemies.

In any open world / RPG, you get so much money it does not mean anything, plus it has almost no use, so what's the point of setting up some currency systems in those games?  
  
I just know one game that does it correctly:  
Wartales ; the game revoles around getting money upon completing contracts / quests. In this game, you need that to pay your mercenaries, and you need to feed them every day to keep them going. So that's a first way of spending your hardly acquired currency. You need money to recruits guys. You need money to buy some material in order to improve your gears. It's a good and quite healthy currency system where you really feel the impact of what you earn.

In a different genre, Fallout 4 with the mod Horizon adds a lot of scarcity to the game. No that much around the currency (caps), but more about the material you need to upgrade your camp / rifles / armor / power armor. Also the raw food is pretty bad to you so you need to hunt and cook your own food so that you don't get ill. Same for the water (or you can buy purified water, that sort of stuff).",lz2nfkl,gaming

Of course, a good indie is almost certainly going to have a much lower cost of entry across the board too, if AAA is too much of a risk

For the other consoles, patience goes a long way, you can get last year's AAA titles for £10-20 easily enough if you go used.

It gets slightly better when you get more inventory slots and get better materials for crafting more durable weapons but I honestly find it such a chore.

I also disagree with your notion regarding barrier to entry.

an average paperback novel has 300 - 400 pages, thats ten hours of reading, for an average of fifteen bucks. between the multimedial presentation, non-linearity and interactivity, I would argue games offer at least equal value of money for entertainment per hour.



I have expensive books that I never managed to read past the first chapter as much as I have games that I bought full price on launch that I didnt play for an hour. so that outcome is also not unique to games.

  
and while my local library carries many important works and periodicals, I would be hard pressed to find recent belletristica there. My gut feeling is indeed that it is easier to access discounted games faster, than it is possible with novels

  
and then there is the entire content creation ecosystem. I can find reviews and letsplays for even the most obscure games.

The first point (labeled 0 for some reason) had nothing to do with games.

The next point about European mythology being the ""basis"" for fantasy settings might have had merit with better examples, but it's rendered moot by the fact most of the clips shown are from a **Japanese** studio, bastardizing European aesthetics for what *their* current culture considers cool. They go on to address how politics are represented in games briefly, but don't really make a point other than that it happens, or sometimes doesn't (in the case of Monster Hunter *not* chiding you for hunting these infinitely respawning pixels when irl that would make them go the way of the buffalo.)

The one *labeled* ""Why are games so infused with war?"" would actually be solid... as a separate video, since like the first two it has fuck all to do with the thesis of this one. Addressing how *America's* department of defense contracts game companies because war games boost recruitment is something that should be talked about. But it's wholly unrelated to the genocide in Gaza.

3, they *finally* get to the topic of the video, pointing out how Middle/Near Eastern people have been the boogeyman for games since 2001 and are rarely humanized. But now I take issue with the fact they stopped there. This is the one point that could've connected game design to Palestine so far, and they don't even address the underling issue. It's not just Middle Eastern people that have been depicted as villains, but *specifically* Muslims. And that clash with what Americans ignorantly call ""Judeo-Christian"" values, along with a sizable portion seeing supporting Israel as a literal part of fulfilling Revelation, is spurred on by games treating these people like targets. 

4 onward, they kinda just glaze ubisoft and a couple other specific games for historical accuracy and telling the stories of refugees, looping back around to the first irrelevant point. While also ignoring that this generally works better in story format, not shoehorned into a ""game"" with minimal mechanics.

So in conclusion, it's nearly two hours of points that have nothing to do with the title and only 24 minutes of one where they don't even get to the connection that I had to make for them in this summary. It's basically a 10th grader's essay where they didn't know how to fill most of the pages, and in the process of coming up with loosely related other stuff to talk about forgot to include the most important thing from their notes.",lz302gy,gaming

They released lootboxes for skins (CSGO style where the crates are drops and the keys cost real money) called Safes, and you'd need to buy a Drill to open it. One of the new heists at the time, Aftershock, was not only disliked by the community for how it played but also for being product placement for the new Safes.


The community had an outcry, in no small part because Almir, the game's community manager, had said years before publicly that Payday 2 would never get microtransactions like that.


After a short while they decided to walk back on it thanks to community outrage. Safes were changed to not need a Drill to open anymore, and then they later just made all skins drop directly instead. 




Recently Almir answered on a stream that when he said the ""Payday 2 will never have microtransactions"" quote that he was told that by the CEO/lead game dev Bo Andersson.

We are all found of the ideia of *""We need remakes of bad games, not good ones""*, and I was questioning if is it feasible, or ever actually happened.

  
One friend argued ""It happened to Resident Evil 1"". It got us all anguered, obviously, But he actually had a point.

Resident Evil 1 Remake is actually very loyal to the original, has a much better presentation, aged much better, has better gameplay mechanics and etc. It actually makes que original feels like a prototype of itself. The problem, obviously, is that Resident Evil 1 was never a bad game. It aged badly, but was a huge hit in its release.

The overall problem with the ""bad game remake"" theory is that is presupposes there is a great idea, that was poorly executed in a bad game, that could show its true colors if were happen to be remade. BUT, all the good ideas of DMC2, as example, were already remade into DMC3. There is no ""good idea"" left trapped inside DMC2. The only thing left there is the plot.

There have been plenty of remakes of bad games but usually theyre bad games that sell well and have an audience. 

Dmc2 has had a couple of remasters because it fits nicely in a collection with 1 and 3. Itd be more confusing if it was just the ""DMC 1 and 3 Collection"" so adding the second game increases value even if nobody wants to touch it. Anyway that was during a time publishers wanted to offer cheap collections of old games instead of milking each remaster for all it's worth. 

I dont see any value in completely remaking the game. Theyd rather create a spinoff. Or a sequel to DmC. Or anything else. There's really not much to work with in dmc2. 

Let's think about Resident Evil series. Every mainline game has been remade at this point up to 4, and we think they're gonna remake 5, but 5 was a bad game. It had fine gunplay but it was a bad Resident Evil with racist undertones that would not fly today. 

Will Capcom decide to remake re5, or just remaster it? I cant see how much value theyd get out of a remake. 

Bungie also never remastered Halo 3 but maybe that's cos they feel the game doesn't need to be remade. I wish theyd fix 4:3 though.",lyzubpp,gaming

Copy paste defuse bombs, copy paste outpost, race Firefly 3 times around the city the same way, chase the APC around the city the same way, copy paste everything.

The mission variety just fell completely apart.

It was also disappointing to see it so heavily Joker focused as I thought that story had concluded. I understand why though, because without Joker the Arkham Knight is not a very interesting villain.

The stability issues seem resolved, however the game did crash on me and even legitimately BSOD my computer. Internet told me to turn off the Nvidia settings and things were fine afterwards.

On the batmobile side, I found that the early game pushes the batmobile really hard, really early. Which is understandable because it's the flagship feature of the game. In most people cases however, they are eager to do Batman things, not blow up tanks.

Even with that said, the batmobile ended up growing on me. The pacing around it is just a bit off and leaves a bad first impression.

Other than that, I loved the game. Perhaps even more than Asylum and City. Really loved how all the villains were out doing their own things in the city and you could flush them out, beat the shit out of them and lug them back to the pound in your car.",lyyv2hi,gaming

In summary, the only good thing that came from Rare after microsoft was Viva Pinata for me. Now take into consideration how many classic franchises were lost, how many great games we could have gotten if it wasn't for the acquisition, they went from one of the biggest names in the industry, to just a inconsistent company that, at best, sometimes gives us good games, and at worst insult their own legacy.

It's done, you've officially gotten the best gear in the game, and with a looter-shooter, getting better gear is kinda the whole point.  So then I keep playing for a while, enjoying the fancy gun, and then I slowly sink into depression as I realize there's literally no point to what I'm doing anymore.

1. Mild blues. Usually during the lead up to the release of a game I have been looking forward to. There is only one thing that will fill that hole, and I just have to bide my time.

2. Severe blues. After finishing a really good game. The hole that will leave behind won't be filled again for a long time, and no matter how hard I try to get into something else, it never scratches the same hitch.

Usually, to get around it, I have a couple of options that work. 

Just play a genre I don't usually play. I'm mostly into action, be it rpg, adventure, or some sort of shooter. If I'm not feeling any of that, I'll try something else, like strategy. This is enough for the milder blues. 

The other option that is guaranteed to work is just not game at all. I have other hobbies, so I dedicate more time to something else. If that involves not being in the same space I game in, then even better.",lz2grvy,gaming

By using their own in-game browser, they're exempt from the Steam workshop rules, and mod creators can charge for mods, giving a considerable cut(I believe it was a whopping 50%) to the developer. Secondarily; Steam Workshop can only provide mods to Steam users. If a game has crossplay across platforms, there needs to be a way to deliver mods to those other platforms, as well, so people can actually play together, easiest way to ensure mod compatibility and crossplay with mods, is to have the mods accessible and delivered in game.",lyv1z7y,gaming

Baldur's Gate 3 lets you play as a demon-race called Tiefling, and you can pick a class like warlock or wizard or sorcerer to do magic and charm people. Easy demoness magic vibes there. You can play it on PC but depending on your PC specs it might run poorly. Alternativly, Divinity Original Sin 2 is very similar to BG3 and has dark magic options.

I want to say that Monster Hunter Dark Prince MIGHT scratch your itch, but I think you have to play as a man/youngboy. Pretty sure it's on Switch and PC.

Code Vein might be an interesting choice. Pretty customizable and you use dark blood powers for your combat. Magic is unlocked a little after the tutorial but I assure you that magic is in the game as well. Less challenging than a Dark Souls game but it is in the same style of gameplay. 

Dishonored 2 you can play as an actual empress with dark magic powers, but you're a human and not a demoness. I'm pretty sure it's on the Vita and PC but not 100% on Vita.

If you want to get into something really weird. Crusader Kings 2 and 3 both let you form dark magic cults as your kingdom, so you can make an empress whose kingdom focuses on dark magic. Never touched the cult stuff too too much, but I remember my empress randomly gave birth to a demon baby one day and that was kinda wild.

Other games to check out might be Dynasty Warriors or Warrior's Orochi. Both have character customization (depending on the entry) and let you use dark magic. I'm pretty sure Dynasty Warriors comes with a default dark enchanter-type lady as a character.

1. I think they made some nice quality of life changes for Totk (just one example, unlike botw, if you open a chest to find a weapon but you are full, instead of backing out of the chest to drop an item and go back into the chest like before, they let you choose an item to drop right away) 
2. The sky and abyss were not boring to me and offered unique gameplay from the main overworld. To each their own 
3. You can get crazy creative with the build mechanics. If you can think of it, it will likely work. 
4. The powers in this game are different enough from the previous champion powers that it does make you play differently. Which I appreciated. 
5. Having played botw very thoroughly, the “new” factor was missing this time which was a shame, but revisiting places that had some changes was cool, made hyrule feel a bit more alive.

Tears is obviously good. It has a ton of amazing features, its environment is the same as BOTW but expanded on and changed, but I just can’t get a comfortable “flow state” going. It constantly feels like I’m running into puzzles or problems that take me forever to figure out. There are just so many tools and options that I often find myself forgetting I can even do the most basic things, and so when I figure it out it doesn’t feel rewarding it makes me feel like an idiot for wasting so much time.

HP has been the most solid so far with only a handful having NVME drive failures(cheapest SK Hynix apparently). However HP has had the most issues with their brand docking stations. Thankfully everything was purchased with extended warranty so we had each repaired and replaced accordingly. All the Lenovo's were replaced with HPs since and they are holding up nicely.

Many people around me have their shit together, at least the basics (money/career, family, friends, worldliness) and I'm still trying to make sense of it all.

There is a silver lining though.. I think in an abstract way, it's quite meaningful having less meaning. It's both frustrating yet liberating in the sense that we have more freedom to explore, and wander around in the sandbox that is life. Ignorance is bliss, but life is perhaps more meaningful when filled with wonder and curiosity, an endless horizon of opportunity.

And find a path to get there.

As for successful people, or those who you think are successful...if you can...ask them how they got to where they are.  Successful people weren't always successful.  They tried and failed at things you have no idea how many times. But they managed to get up and go try again.

It's like telling someone who is depressed to cheer up, because look here's me showing a sad face but big things are coming because I am now smiling. But you ignore why they are depressed and what is blocking them from doing the chores in the first place.

Don’t blame yourself or your ex-that’s just what happens! They’ll prefer one parent to another from time to time. Completely to be expected, too, and don’t take it too personally. Here’s a thought; after he and his spouse separated, My brother in law did a wonderful thing (when the kids became school age): he wrote  a letter to each of them every week. Just talking about his week and thinking about them and so on. Since he did a lot of traveling, it was his habit to spend his first day away sitting down in the evening to write about three paragraphs. But he also did this when he was at home. The kids felt like they were important and treasured some of these letters.  And he and they would get together, there was always something  to talk about. Even if you’re “not a writer”, give some thought to doing something similar! He kept it up until they graduated from high school. They tearfully snd lovingly read some of these letters at his funeral. The ex had always been a helpful partner in reading these letters to the kids when they were in elementary school.

I just went through a gnarly divorce with 3 kids. I didn’t lie to them, but didn’t blame their mom or tell them what an absolute demon she was being. I blamed “the court” for why I couldn’t see them instead of their mom. Don’t fight in front of them, don’t badmouth their mom.

Mine are about the ages of yours and it was really hard on them. CONSTANTLY show them love and reassure them that they didn’t do anything wrong. My middle one struggled with blaming himself and it killed me. My youngest (4) doesn’t really get it. My oldest (10) has a lot of anger. It’s just part of it. 

As far as surviving it, I went to the gym. A lot. Got real fuckin strong lol and had a few close friends as confidants and moral support. That will carry you through a lot. 

Not sure if yours will be nasty or not, but mine got bad almost immediately. Things didn’t turn in my favor until I stopped trying to be the nice guy and stopped trying to do it amicably.

I finally told my lawyer to go scorched earth, rescind all offers and take everything. Now I have 50/50 custody, which is all I cared about in the first place.

I dont know how contentious the divorce is right now but you need to plan on it getting worse. Get your own lawyer and be the first to file. If you are in the US the table is tilted towards the woman and most likely she will get the kids. Above all, keep your emotions under wraps and stick to facts and figures. The court doesnt care who did what to whom as long as it wasn’t illegal. They dont care how you feel. Don't get mad in court and don't react to anything that is done. Make sure your lawyer gets your requirements for everything (finances, custody arrangements, property splits, etc.) in writing and presented to the court. Most of all, be ready for the shitty stuff if it happens. My ex was getting really bad information from someone and was acting on it and repeatedly went to court about things that were based on emotion and not facts and pissed the judge off several times with outrageous demands. Keep to the facts and stay calm. Only you and her know what happened. People will judge you based on any bit of information they hear. Ignore them.

Sounds like you're locked in on two negative thought processes.  One is worrying too much about what others think of you, and the other is trying to fix everything at once.  

Get off the internet for awhile.  Stop looking at social media feeds.  Stop listening to Tiktok gurus.  Separate your life.  One part is what you do for your body, the other is what you do for your mental state.  Eat right, exercise regularly, read some self improvement books that help you communicate with other people.  Start with one or two things that are simple but need a bright line discipline.  i.e. No Sugar for one month, or two mile walk everyday, rain or shine, read one book a week, or an exercise program.  

Understand that most people have an addiction/habit they have to deal with, and addictions and habits are all about dopamine response.  Maybe it is not drugs or alcohol, it can be fast food, sex, sugar, shopping, gambling, need for attention, masturbation, or self grooming habits.  Figure out why you act the way you act. ""Know Thyself"".  Learn your triggers, and figure out a way to deal with them.

People smell desperation and it is a super big turnoff.  Stop needing it so much, whatever it is.  Even if you can't stop the feeling, stop the behaviors that are showing people you are desperate and therefore putting people off. 

Take care of your hygiene, begin an exercise program, watch something that other people want  to talk about.  Watch some football and cheer on the local team even if you don't like it (or whatever is the most popular sport there is).  This gives you common ground with other people you are surrounded by.  If you're overly focused on one special interest you're cutting yourself off from a wider audience.  Sure, there's like minded people out there for that passion project, but you have to operate in a wider community day by day.  Look yourself in the mirror before you leave the house and check your style/appearance/presentation.  You don't have to be rich to dress well, and dressing and grooming well are one part of the message you send to other people about who you are, what you identify with, and how you feel about yourself.

Stop expecting quick results.  It takes months of work to overcome a habit or to just begin to change the appearance/health of your body.  Keep at it and if nothing else, you will garner other people's respect for your discipline and effort.",lyxj21k,GetMotivated

Try to frequent an area of interest, whether it's a school club, cafe, or some community (could be sports too). Through being forced into interactions, it does help connect with others. In terms of finding a balance between putting yourself out there and people pleasing, I think that you have to just try your best to be yourself without necessarily placing too much pressure on yourself to have others like you. Things like being a good listener, showing interest(genuinely) and just showing up are pretty much all you need to build a circle lol. I'm not making guarantees but this would be a start.

Being secure in yourself comes with understanding and accepting yourself. Accepting the person you are today,  the decisions you made in the past and what came with that. Developing yourself mentally, physically, or even spiritually can definitely boost your self esteem, but really you want to be able to accept yourself with or without some huge change in your life. I practically use a stoic approach to find peace in what was and what is. Change takes time. The fact you want to move forward in life is commendable, and as long as you can keep trying, be willing to fail, and get up again, im sure you'll find progress in your journey. Don't be so hard on yourself, just take it step by step. Good luck",lyxpww4,GetMotivated

- pick just one thing that YOU want to make better for yourself. Then go do it to the best of your ability. No one can do more than their best and only YOU can decide what that is.

You may need to accept the fact that you may be without a gf or friends for years. First thing: know thyself. Exercise every morning. Read every day (audiobook is ok too). Eat whole foods and minimally processed foods 99% of the time. This means, maybe 1 ultra processed food per month. Every day you will make progress. On hard days you will need to be extra aware and extra patient. Maintain your pace on the uphills. Fly on the downhills. Every year is 365 times to grow. Depending on where you’re at in life, growing 365 times is likely not enough. Likely, you may need to grow 500 times or maybe even 600 times before you are and perceive different. But remember, you must put the effort to grow DAILY. If this helps, please remember to help someone else when you are ready and when you can. 

P.s. put your struggles into context. Many men and women have gone through it, and are going through it, and have shared their experiences.

You'll probably never fully be rid of the imposter syndrome, if my experience is anything to go by. It'll still pop up here and there. But what has done a lot for me, trite as it sounds, is redefining ""success."" I was born to lower-middle class parents, so I had fewer advantages available to me throughout my life (though I definitely still had my share). I realized long ago that my chances of ""making it"" in the way most people understand it are fairly slim, and that keeping myself alive and safe were about as good as I could hope for, especially as late-stage capitalism continues to fuck people over.

About a year and a half ago I learned of a new scholarship available to residents of my state, and I decided to take the leap and go back to school, having not yet finished a degree. I changed my track to IT support, seeing how everything runs on computers these days and that means job security pretty much anywhere in the world. Not long after I started, I began encountering different manifestations of community support centered around computer literacy and repair, and decided that what I'd really like to do, what would be most meaningful to me, is to do what I can to keep the more marginalized folks in my community from falling through the technology cracks because they can't afford a fancy computer or don't know how to use them, etc. So I'm going to learn as much as I can to help the most people I can. 

And that's basically what redefining success means, to me. Figure out what your values are, and from there figure out what is most meaningful to you. There is no one with the same life or experiences as you, so trying to define ""success"" for yourself using someone else's measurements won't do you much good. [This](https://getpocket.com/read/669g3d8ep748aA46d6T418bo0xAZp57904dJNHnbOum099yd5a17bwZmK86rv959_6941ebb58a3e0857ddd521e44d13cf46) is an article that popped up in my Pocket suggestions that I found pretty helpful. Something else that helped was using the app [Betwixt](http://betwixt.life). It has a peculiar but effective way of helping you figure out what your values are.

I still feel like I'm in the rat race a bit, even if it's less like running toward the mythical goal of ""The American Dream"" and more like running from the rising water in a sinking ship. But rather than trying to keep up with the others, I'm finding different routes that work for me and the people I care about, and still keep us dry.

Your brain believes whatever you tell it repeatedly. Even if you don’t actually believe what you are saying! But you have to say it in a positive way. 

So every time you catch yourself thinking a thought that you want to change, say your new replacement thought instead. Say it out loud if you’re alone. Or just think it to yourself if you can’t say it. 

Saying it in a positive way means, say “I am a resilient person” (positive) rather than “I no longer am weak” (negative).

One failed attempt isn’t the end; it’s a chance to learn a new way to approach a difficult situation and grow. When it feels overwhelming, owning your story can help you connect with others who share your struggles, opening doors to support and new perspectives.

Since then I talked to people and even coached some people at my work. Here's what I found: 
1. people do not know basic stuff until somebody is the first one to tell them. 
2. Once they know it, there is a constant influx of new (young and old) users that have not yet heard the 'obvious' thing. 
3. If you are into something (for you it's fitness, for me home organisation and interior design) you are in the bubble of 'knowers', but not everyone is in that bubble and you might become their introduction/ guide.
4. I watch, read and listen to lots of content about interior design and home organisation even though I already know what the creator will most likely highlight. People love to be reassured on one hand, surprised with a small bit of new info they have not heard before on the other AND if they disagree they live to comment their own findings, opinions and even studies you might not have heard about before, so it's also a learning opportunity for the creator. 
5. Some creators have boring content knowledge -wise, but they present it in a way that is entertaining, inspiring or drive the basic point home better. That is why we consume this content. If knowledge was all people wanted we would not have thousands of channels showing a closet reorganisation ideas and hundreds more with kitchen declutter process and 'how to pick curtains'.

- my pet beetles. it was incredibly important to me that I cleaned my depression cave before they arrived, I dont want to attract any bugs that could crawl in and harm my beetles, so I needed to make sure my space was clean first. I'm starting to eat healthier because im already preparing veggies for my pets anyways, and they wont finish a whole pack of spinach or a whole zucchini before it goes bad, so I might as well have some too. it's also very grounding to watch them crawl around, something I can rely on to make me smile

- nearly completely pushing away my friends because I was so disconnected from myself and my actions that I didnt recognize that I was hurting them. I'm really glad that I started feeling like myself again, and that I was able to recognize what I was doing and start repairing those relationships.

- passing out because of an anxiety attack i had while high and alone. my friends and my mom had told me that I should take a break from weed but I didnt listen, and it started becoming something that I would hide, then be ashamed of, and it really started impacting my mental health.

I can tell that I'm starting to heal, and I'm starting to accept that it's going to take longer than I want to get where I want to be, I'm trying to be okay with that. it kills me that I cant be that person now, but those habits will be more sustainable if they're slowly built and worked on, rather than if I were to just through myself into a new life like I've tried so so many times before.

A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.

We are not in the wrong place, we are no worse off than humans ever were. Societal, individual, cultural drift accounts for the mundanity of modern life.

I have chronic fatigue so it's difficult, but breaking exercise up into smaller segments at different times can help. Or just force yourself to exercise for just 15 min and remind yourself that small changes have huge results when they're consistent 

2. I don’t have time to cook or exercise 

The time to cook/exercise is when you're scrolling on your phone or staring at the tv. No you probably won't feel like it, but just cook something simple or do a 15 minute YouTube workout, or go for a short walk etc. Meal prep if you ever get a day off to yourself, but I have a toddler so that ain't happening. Tonight I just did microwaved steamed fish fillet (birds eye) and cooked cauliflower pieces in microwave and added some cheese, herbs

3. Gym membership and/or home equipment is too expensive 

If you truly don't earn enough to afford it or you can't reduce your spending on other things then go for a walk, do YouTube workouts that don't require weights, use any outdoor gym equipment at parks (they're not great but neither is sitting doing nothing)

4. Nutritious food is too expensive 

Idk I'm in Australia and fast food is really expensive here, we rarely have dollar menu type stuff. Meat can get expensive but go to aldi or wherever and look for discounted stuff &amp; sales. Get vegetables that are in season and cheap. To know if they're in season, just see if they're cheap haha. Tinned tuna, put it with cheese and salad on a ""baked"" (microwaved) whole potato. Use people's codes for heavily discounted hello fresh type boxes

5. I hate exercise 

I don't want to do it, I'm always exhausted and sore. But there are types that are more tolerable. 

6. I have an injury or health condition that prevents me from exercising 

Depends on what it is. If you can still safely walk then do that, just start small and build up. Same with swimming or walking in a pool. If nothing in your upper body is injured then maybe you could do upper body weights that don't put strain on a lower body injury, etc. you're usually not supposed to become sedentary with common injuries, but check with doctor. 

7. Nutritious food is too bland/boring

Not if you add spices, herbs, sauces, cheese etc. just eat healthier versions of what you like. 

8. I’m addicted to high-sugar/junk foods

Make healthier versions or buy healthier versions. Switch to sweeteners if you must. Crowd the junk food out with good food that you still like, don't just try to cut the junk out and eat at a big calorie deficit or you'll crave those types of food even more. Get your blood sugar checked. 

9. I don’t know how to exercise properly

Just walk if you're able. If you go to a gym, invest in just 2 PT sessions to get them to show you how to use some equipment, it might be included when you sign up. Don't overdo anything new. 

10. I am overwhelmed by the idea of cooking nutritious food every day 

Meal prep if you ever get the time to do that, or buy things that are quick and can be microwaved like steam fresh flavoured fish fillets, frozen chicken you can oven bake etc. get free or heavily discounted box codes for hello fresh off groups, Reddit, websites etc.",ly9d2b3,GetMotivated

I have full time job, part time school, working on starting up side business, not to mention Autism, ADHD, PTSD and Chronic depression, so coming up with plans to make life work was a must.

1. Meal prep and knowing how to store food to last longer has changed my life around. Thanks to that I always have food to eat on days that I can't cook. Atleast, when you do cook make extra portion so you can save some rest for later. My favorite go to meal is paella or pasta dishes using protein rich pasta, after freezing and warming them up they still taste pretty good. For excercise find the sport that you like. For me it's swimming, and I can work out for the purpose of improving my swimming agility.

2. Same as above. If you schedule around to dedicate on meal prepping you can use the rest of the time to enjoy the meal at covenient time. Shift the mindset to think that even a 30 min excercise is better than nothing.

3. Find a cheaper option like a recreational facility or workout at home with movement that uses your own body weight. Cancel some subscription for services you barely use to afford going to planet fitness.

4. Frozen fruits and veggies are your friend. Also buying in bulk is cheapter in a long run.

5. Same as 1.

6. Consult with doctor on what type of work out can you do that won't harm your body.

7. I've proven myself wrong on this when I started to make my own meals! Find some good recipe books. My favrorite is Healthy Meal prep by Lisa Bryan.

8. Change your mindset around food. I love junk food too but they do not help with my ultimate goal to be healthy. But I also allow myself for opportunity to try new foods or explore local restaurants like once a week. Balance is the key. Also lowering cortisol level is a must. Not stressing out over food and reducing overall stress from various aspect of your life is better than eating healthy but feeling stressed.

9. Hire a trainer, or for cheaper option ask your friend who has experience, or look up You Tube.

Picture this: if someone has had a negative experience with the gender they are attracted to… 

If they lose weight = more attention 
More attention = higher chance of that gender seeing them = higher chance of getting hurt again. 

Even though consciously someone wants to lose weight, subconsciously you could be self sabotaging yourself on your journey. Comfort eating. Not sticking to programmes. Procrastinating. 

The ego/subconscious would do ANYTHING to keep you safe.

&gt; 2.  I don’t have time to cook or exercise 


Meal prep can help with the cooking aspect by condensing the effort required into one or two blocks per week rather than after your work day each day.


If you have the money and a suitable service available in your area, you can often buy ready made healthy meals, or kits of ingredients that reduce the work load and time required.


For exercise, you could try exercising at a different time of day when you're less tired - before work or on a lunch break rather than after work for example.  


Also worth remembering that some exercise is better than no exercise, even if it's just 5 star jumps or push-ups, or a couple minutes walk, or whatever. 


&gt; 3.  Gym membership and/or home equipment is too expensive 


Equipment is not required to exercise, only for specific types of exercise. 


Go for walks or runs. Go swimming. Do star jumps, burpies, push-ups, sit-ups, whatever.  


Build in some exercise to your day by parking further away and walking the difference rather than aiming for spaces as close as possible to doors, or doing shorter trips as a walk rather than driving at all.",lybw72t,GetMotivated

Make your meal colorful! 

You can try adding:
reds (tomatoes, peppers, strawberries, apples), greens (peas, leafy veggies, onion leaks, legumes),
yellows/oranges (lemons, peppers, sesame seeds, potatoes, carrots)

whatever you want just make it colorful. Bland food is bland alone but not nutritious food. Nutritious food is balanced and colourful and presentation also affects the appetite.",lybypl6,GetMotivated

* **Solution:** Start small! Exercise doesn’t need to be an hour-long session. Even a 10-minute walk or a short stretch can help boost your energy. For cooking, meal prepping on days you feel more energetic can save time later. Simple, quick meals like salads or smoothies can be prepared in minutes.

# 2. ""I don’t have time to cook or exercise.""

* **Solution:** Prioritize it. You don’t need hours. Just like anything else, fitness and nutrition should be scheduled. Plan your workouts in the morning or during a break. As for cooking, use a slow cooker, air fryer, or batch cooking on weekends to save time during the week.

# 3. ""Gym membership and/or home equipment is too expensive.""

* **Solution:** There are plenty of ways to work out for free. You can use bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats, lunges), go for a jog, or follow free workout videos online. For equipment, start with minimal gear—resistance bands, dumbbells, or a yoga mat.

# 4. ""Nutritious food is too expensive.""

* **Solution:** You don’t have to buy fancy organic foods to eat healthy. Focus on whole foods like beans, grains, frozen vegetables, and seasonal fruits. Shop in bulk, and consider meal planning to avoid food waste. Discount stores or local farmer’s markets can also be more affordable.

# 5. ""I hate exercise.""

* **Solution:** Find an activity you enjoy. Exercise doesn’t have to mean going to the gym or running. Dancing, hiking, yoga, swimming, or even walking the dog are all great options. The key is consistency, not intensity. Start with what feels fun!

# 6. ""I have an injury or health condition that prevents me from exercising.""

* **Solution:** Talk to a professional about safe alternatives. Many low-impact exercises (like swimming, cycling, or walking) are still possible with injuries. Adapt exercises to your capabilities, and listen to your body.

# 7. ""Nutritious food is too bland/boring.""

* **Solution:** Spice things up! Use herbs, spices, and flavorful condiments (like salsa, tahini, or hot sauce). Experiment with different cuisines to keep things interesting. Try new recipes that combine flavors you love but in healthier ways.

# 8. ""I’m addicted to high-sugar/junk foods.""

* **Solution:** Gradually reduce your sugar intake. Replace sugary snacks with healthier alternatives like fruit, nuts, or homemade energy bars. A sugar detox can be tough, but replacing processed foods with whole foods will help reduce cravings over time.

# 9. ""I don’t know how to exercise properly.""

* **Solution:** There are tons of free resources available to learn proper form. Consider starting with beginner workout videos or apps that guide you. Once you’ve learned a few exercises, you can create a simple routine and gradually increase intensity.

# 10. ""I am overwhelmed by the idea of cooking nutritious food every day.""

* **Solution:** Meal prep! Spend a couple of hours once or twice a week preparing meals. Having pre-chopped veggies, cooked grains, or portioned meals ready to go can make it much easier to stick to nutritious eating.",lyarndc,GetMotivated

This seems a bit over-sensationalized. While I understand where you are coming from, and I genuinely believe you to be very well intentioned, I can't help but translate this to ""you cant change if you don't change"". Change does require change, and I don't think that anyone practically advocating for meditation says its the only way.

We can measure positive impact to brains and body via meditation, \*and\* many other practices. Self improvement, just like any goal to achieve, does in fact require persistent work towards that goal over time. I also think that we often focus too much on the 'ideal' improvement instead of the 'ideal' problem to fix... as in the lowest hanging fruit.

We are all different and sometimes working on improving the most significant negative can yield largest results. Maybe you exercise but your diet is trash? Maybe you eat great but dont exercise? Maybe you diet and exercise but your mind is a mess - and your mind needs reps n sets akin to a bicep? I'm just picking three major common considerations here, but I think you get the idea!

All that being said, I do agree with the conclusion you lay out. Its better to opt for a change you will stick to seeing through, as opposed to a short term attempt which you ultimately discontinue. And, there are many ways to live a happy healthy life. These facts should not be lost focus of.",lya1bc5,GetMotivated

She's the first to admit when something doesn't make sense to her or when she needs a review on a project. Her transparency helps me prevent a lot of errors, and she's growing faster than any of my other associates have. 

All this to say... embrace your opportunity to learn. Ask for feedback and take that as more of a learning opportunity, not an opinion on your capabilities. Remember that your team wants you to be great, and they'll help you get there. You just have to be upfront and ask for the help, and you'll grow incredibly fast!

Business and engineering degree. But still had no clue what I was doing. I'll tell you the secret. We never know what we're doing. That's because tech changes so fucking fast. 

 We make suggestions and do what the ""best practices"" say to do. The business makes the decision to go or no go with those best practice suggestions we make. The best thing I have learned in tech is CYA (cover your ass). If someone tells you something for you to do, or you make a change, document why you made it and when you made it and who authorized it. Send that shit in a ticket or email to someone else so there is record. Find something that interests you and start learning it. That may be a career move. 

But in 10 years that technology may be gone or that company may be bought and priced out of existence. Tape backups are still a thing but not nearly as big as cloud right now. Companies are struggling with VMware right now because of pricing from broadcom. 

WFH sucks unless you can effectively utilize your time to learn and still interact with others. Isolation in tech is an issue. 

I have had many positions where my team sat in a dark basement as the IT team.

Congratulations on the position. It took me almost 10 years to like a position I was in. I was jumping every 1.5 to 2 years for pay increases and title increases. Got let go because I didn't CYA twice (never fun) so those 1 on 1 are valuable moments to learn and get mentoring from your lead, but also get feedback on how your progress is.

If itʻs a multi-step thing, I focus on one step at a time and break them down into as small a step as I need them to be. Like going in for my induction, I wasnʻt really scared but it was a hugely massive deal for me so I was very nervous not knowing what to expect. I just focused on getting dressed, then making sure all my bags were packed and I had everything. Then putting shoes on. Then getting in the car. Then the drive. Then checking in to the hospital. Just one thing at a time, whatʻs the next thing and the next and the next, and deliberately refusing to dwell on the great unknown that was going to be the culmination of the entire process.

Scary Hour is an hour where I do things I need to get done that I’ve been dreading, that I’ve been putting off, or are anxiety-inducing in some way. Usually for me that’s things like reading and replying to emails and messages, making phone calls, paying bills, etc. I’ve made sure to set the parameters for myself that Scary Hour ONLY lasts an hour, no matter what, and I can ONLY do Scary Things during it. If you’ve got tasks that are going to take longer than an hour, I’d recommend breaking them down into smaller tasks so that you can have some to fully complete in that hour - I’d recommend breaking them down anyway, but especially if you’re making them Scary Hour tasks.

The key for me is that I hype myself up in the few minutes beforehand and then once it starts, I just GO on the tasks without giving myself time in between to think about whatever it is that makes them scary. Somehow having the rules do Scary Hour in place makes that a little easier, but I definitely acknowledge that just telling your anxiety “nope, I don’t have time for you” and pushing through is easier said than done. I sort of think of it like making impulsivity work for me - I see or think of the task and JUMP into doing it without thinking it through. Sometimes doing a “1, 2, 3, GO” countdown in my head helps, but often I use “Come on Barbie, let’s go party” as my countdown lol.

Also, I’m often a lot more successful with this if I tell a friend I’m doing it and send them an update at the end, or sometimes they join in and do their own Scary Hour at the same time. Sometimes we do this on a video call, like not chatting or anything but just having the call up while we both work, or sometimes just knowing someone is doing it at the same time is helpful!

Oh, and having a little reward at the end :) I’m not very good at rewarding myself, either I give in early or don’t follow through, so sometimes I’ll have a friend or someone help out. So for example, I ask my friend to send me some cute pictures of her kids or to find a few funny memes for me to have *only* when I’ve finished. Or if there’s something I want to tell her/talk about, I’ll say/text that I really want to tell them about XYZ but only after I’m done with a task or Scary Hour.",lxxln1y,GetMotivated

Ok, to be serious, what gets me out of bed and what is motivating me currently are thoughts of my future. 

I want a wife and I want to be the best wife that I can be. Right now, I'm doing everything I can to prepare my mind, body, and finances for her and our future family. One day, my dreams will be a reality and what a sweet, sweet day that will be. That thought fuels me.

Also, waking up alive is a great motivator. I've seen death in my life and traveled to a few countries and it has taught me how life is such a gift.  The fact that I have another day to get out there and enjoy this world, love people, pursue my dreams, and be alive excites me.

What gets my rear up at 5:30am is that I have a PT test that I can't fail. I also want to be strong, capable, and able.

Man. Thank you Op, this question rocks, and I've been able to put my ""why"" into words. I'm all pumped up now. 

&gt;There was a time when my motivation was all about my career, like climbing the ladder and proving I could do it. It worked for a bit, but I started feeling like something was missing. That’s when I realized I needed something more personal to keep me grounded.

I worked at startups and gave them my all, but those projects were never truly “mine.” Now I’m essentially doing the same kind of work as before, but even without a paycheck, I feel more driven. When I had a regular job, I often felt empty (kind of like what you mentioned in your post) and found myself constantly seeking “balance.”

Balance, to me, is an interesting concept. Sure, life needs balance. But when you’re deeply passionate about something, balance doesn’t even cross your mind. The very idea of seeking balance seems to imply there’s some resistance holding you back from fully committing.

Another thought is that “comparison” can dilute everything. Like you said, climbing the ladder ultimately isn’t enough. I use [an app](https://go.clarymind.com/bBQpGm) to block most social media (especially Instagram) and unfollow accounts that stress me out.

Over time I feel more grounded in life. Even when I see classmates getting promotions or switching jobs, I immediately know, “That’s not the life I want.” I’m living the life I’ve always wanted, and that sense of fulfillment is unlike anything I’ve ever felt before.",lxsn3zm,GetMotivated

From what you say, I gather that the feedback that you’re getting from your teachers might not be as helpful as it’s meant to be. Are they specifying why your work isn’t good enough? Are they asking you to provide more detail, clearer examples, or something else? Is it more of an issue with writing style or punctuation? Do they give examples of the kind of work they expect from you?

I don’t know what you’ve discussed with your teacher before, but I suggest asking for them to talk over their feedback with you. See if you can identify the things that are still unclear to you, so you can specifically ask about those things.

Regarding the other eight projects—can you start them before you’ve finished the current one? If so, I definitely think you should. If they’re all different from each other, you won’t necessarily suffer in the same ways while doing them. Maybe they’ll go by really quickly!

There's different ways to practice self compassion. One way is to focus on positive things about yourself. Just name one thing about yourself that you're proud of. Make it a habit. Soon enough you will feel better about yourself and remember that you're a valuable person and from there you will start to welcome new opportunities, for example big goals like taking driving license.

Maybe start with something that feels less overwhelming. If making friends is on your mind, try something low-pressure like joining a group with shared interests. Even tiny actions like that can build momentum. For bigger things like driving or finishing school, don’t feel like you need to tackle it all at once.

Looking at the end goal can be super discouraging.

For instance. Someone wants to lose 40 pounds. Well instead of focusing on that 40. Break it up to smaller goals. Im going to loose 10 pounds over the next 8 weeks, walk, workout, drink enough water and eat meat and veggies.

When you accomplish that first small goal it gives you momentum to keep moving forward. You also gain a ton of confidence along the way because you see what you can do.

For a long time, I believed the voice in my head that said, “You can’t”

But something kept me moving. It wasn’t about believing I could do everything I set my mind to from the start..I didn’t. I just focused on the next small step: proving to myself that I could endure, that I could learn, and that I could grow.

Eventually, those small victories added up. I rebuilt relationships, pursued education, learned from mistakes and created a life where I could give back to those who supported me. The toughest barrier wasn’t a lack of capability...it was overcoming my own doubts and the limits I’d set in my mind.

What made the difference? Learning that progress isn’t about innate gifts but about the willingness to take the next step, even when it feels impossible. If you’re doubting yourself, take a deep breath and remind yourself you don’t have to do it all today.

- What is the program? 
- What will it allow you to achieve? (E.g., become a doctor, psychologist, etc.) 
- What skills or training will the program help you gain to achieve that goal? 
- Why is it this school’s program the best fit for you? (They want to hear good things about themselves) 

Start by writing out bullet points of what each question is actually asking you. Remember: they are assessing how well you will do in the program. Are you motivated? Will you actually choose and thrive in their program? (Not just any program) Why? What is the evidence you cite in your essays to demonstrate this? 

Ideally, you’d have some people you know who have gotten in to this type of program to ask for examples of their statements, write several drafts, and get feedback from graduate students or professors on your essays. Given the timeline, I’d suggest using Google for ideas to get started but do not follow this too closely. Absolutely do not plagiarize. 

They are ultimately assessing whether you (1) are truly interested in and a fit for their program and will succeed, (2) can write well, and (3) have enough awareness of what professional programs are looking for. I.e., Do not overshare with things like, “I have always struggled with my mental health.” I don’t recommend sharing personal details like this unless you do so very thoughtfully and tactfully, because it can come off an unprofessional. It’s hard to explain what this looks like through text. You can include some autobiographical details but they need to make sense within the context of your story/essay. (For example, having a grandparent pass away from lung cancer may have been the moment you decided to become a doctor and be relevant for an essay on why you want to pursue a medical career, but not be relevant for a program in anthropology.)",lxk0qu6,GetMotivated

Imagine how a person who runs that story as an operating system would behave under different circumstances. As you run into roadblocks, can iterate and change lines to give you the human operating system that doesn't feel distress in adversity but enjoys it. An unproductive personal storytelling is one that acts like a mental prison. The secret of mental prisons is there is no lock on the door, can simply open the door and walk out through a different personal storytelling.

Well understood in psychology around persuasion, marketing, (and hypnosis). You start to see examples of this with the declared values of a corporation. Or used in military branches as a creed their soldiers memorize. How those storytelling exercises are structured is based on the behaviors encouraged in that group. You can write your own.

Consider excerpt from the Navy Seal's Creed. How would a person who runs this as their operating system act in situations they're presented with? Can just, make your own like this. No one is stopping you. No one to ask permission.

&gt; ""I will never quit. I persevere and thrive on adversity. My nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies. If I get knocked down, I will get back up, every time. I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission. I am never out of the fight.""

I compulsively feel the need to always try new things. She absolutely loathes it. Whether it’s movie/TV, restaurants, stores, trying new routes on the road, whatever. 

If we regularly return to a restaurant, I’ll keep trying new things til I’ve tried the whole menu, where she’ll pick a safe item to stick with until she can lock in a favourite based on what she’s seen/smelled/tasted of I’ve ordered. Anything new she does suggest (like switching to lite n easy meal deliveries) is something to be celebrated, but it also usually comes with days if not weeks of research and ideally word of mouth testimonials. 

I think it’s risk aversion? She considers getting something that’s a bit crap to be a terrible result to be avoided at all costs and a justification to never try new things, whereas I consider it a valuable lesson, and the price to be paid for the opportunity to possibly be pleasantly surprised.

Fear is usually a lack of knowing how to *properly* respond to a situation.  You keep putting yourself in unfamiliar situations, you end up developing a bunch of *general* coping mechanisms to replace your fear.

As you encounter failures, which you will as you keep trying new stuff, you'll also work on overcoming it and emotionally regulating yourself.

I had similar feelings when I was in high school- I was so completely unmotivated to continue, and similar to the feelings you have, I had no desire to continue my education. I think a lot of people have given some great advice so far- this is my spin on it. 

* Take care of your mental and physical health. I don't know anything about your situation outside of what you said, but please do not be afraid to seek out and utilize resources you have available. Your future self will thank you.
* Your priorities and desires are going to change in the future. You may or may not decide to pursue more education in the future, and no judgement either way. Your pursuit of happiness and joy will take different turns, and nothing is forever. I found it more difficult to have this perspective when I was younger, but this becomes more clear over time. 
* From a practical standpoint, understand that your future without a high school diploma will statistically be more difficult from a financial standpoint. Yes, there are outliers, but your average person will have more opportunities and simply earn more with a high school degree. I don't know if that perspective helps or not, but something to consider.
* Can you think of at least how some of the subjects at school apply to what you're passionate about (I assume, music)? Like, if your music career took off, how would the fundamental knowledge of things like math, business, etc. help you to further this dream?

It’s more about understanding instructions, learning methods, discipline, focus, time management, social skills etc which are all the skills you need to succeed in life. The basic lessons are important too of course.

I don’t remember what I studied in HS but I do remember how to lead a discussion, what to do if I have to work with someone I don’t like, etc.

But you can’t force yourself to care if you’re out of capacity to care. Fact is, you can do things even when it doesn’t matter. It’s okay to be passionate about something else, high school is just a short period of time compared to the years and years that are coming soon. In a way, it won’t matter that much down the line. But the future is not here yet, and right now HS matters because it’s your present.

Secondly, proxychains may leak non-tcp traffic like DNS traffic (https://www.dnsleaktest.com/), if not configured correctly in the config file If you just want to proxy through Tor, use torsocks, which prevents such leaks by default.

Thirdly, what's your proxychains config file?

If it’s not part of your day job, finding a goal or reason to do it can be the hardest part. I’d always have a goal, like a crackme, or CTF, or some question you want answered. Even if it’s, “how does this function look in assembly.” But just saying, “I’m going to reverse this binary/program” will leave you discouraged with no real measure of success or place to start. 

Knowing the tools available and where they shine is also a large part of being successful. So you could try doing a challenge with something like Ghidra, and then say, “okay, how could I do this using other tools like stings and objdump instead.” If you focus on just the low level tools, you’ll miss out on the cool technology that’s being put into some of these advanced tools, but if you only use the heavy guns, you might create gaps in your knowledge for how programs are actually put together and how the tools do some of the “magical” things that they do.

Also being able to recognize when to approach the problem statically or dynamically and what tools you need for both. Again, you could repeat challenges, seeing if you could solve it either way and see which was made more sense or which you find yourself more drawn to.

Baring that, I'll assume that this is a device that is not currently in use, but you have been given under some weird circumstance: Are any of the numbers showing heavy wear and tear? If so, I would think of logical combinations of those codes. I.e. Lowest to highest, various key patterns (left-right, left-right) You can also try common numbers like 36-24-36, 31337, 80085, 12345, 54321, 86753, etc. If you know what building it came from, what was the building number? What was the zip code for that building?

If that doesn't work, it would be good to do some research. See if Internet Archive or various Web Caches have anything from the brand name. Maybe old forum posts. You can also try and look based on model number, or something like ""(model number) instruction manual"" sometimes default codes are printed in the booklet. Maybe YouTube has a brief review of it.

Assuming the default code is findable, it'd then be a matter of unplugging the device and safely discharging the capacitors/batteries/etc. No power would presumably clear out the memory after a short time, and would then be reset to the factory default.

If all of that fails, and you end up wanting to go the software route, we would need more info on the device itself and how to find the software in question. If it's really old, it might be easily defeated, but it also might not be. I try to eliminate physical weaknesses before moving onto software exploits.",lydscvk,hacking

Mind you, as I stated, this was *many years ago*.

You just deauth all the clients on the network, grab the password hash on them reconnecting and then crack the hash.

with hashcat being able to use GPUs and multiple GPUs, cracking WPA/WPA2 is nothing.

There are also websites like HashMob where you can upload the password hashes and others with powerful rigs will even crack them for you (free or paid).

Also with popular wifi routers like Netgear and shit that use a default password type of adjective + noun + 3 numbers, people made lists to help crack these faster.

You can even rent GPU VPSs on places like DigitalOcean that have 8x H100s to crack from. ALso services liek Vast.ai to crack with.

For rented hash cracking:

- Pros: It's a lot of fun and you can get a lot of hash cracking power
- Cons: It's ~$27/hour

Vulnerability research essentially boils down to locating ""interesting"" places in software where bugs could have a security impact - parsers for user controlled input, servers handling user requests, etc. - and drilling into specific places within them until you find something:)

As with any form of research, it isn't easy and you'll hit plenty of deadends, but it's fun and experience definitely helps with the process.

To get started with memory corruption related research I highly recommend CTFs - pwnable.kr, pwnable.tw, pwncollege and the likes.

Hacking is simply just interacting with the computer in a way that has not been taken into account for by the developers. If the developers messed up really bad you may be able to find a way to interact with the computer that gives you access to it and reveal a zero day vulnerability.

Then you need  to develop your exploit. ROP comes into play here. Ideally looking for the memory address of where libc is loaded. Looking to craft a ret2libc type approach, where you can exec /bin/sh .
If you're looking for priv escalations, good places to fuzz are daemons bound below port 1024, anything suid, anything in userspace configured to access physical hardware.  

There are some excellent books on the subject like gray hat hacking, or hacking the art of exploitation.

Watch this talk by Daniel Cooper at Bsides

I think it provides a very good insight into how zero days are found. 

It actually made me feel stupid watching it, because there is no way I would have discovered what he did.

Ultimately CVEs are on a scale, some are not that hard to find, some are incredibly difficult to find. I liken it to finding a bargain in a thrift store, not that hard to find something for $2 that is worth $5. But finding a rare piece of art for $5 that is worth $500,000, not easy.

There are a few qualities that are evident when you watch Daniel talk that make him equipped to find 0 days:
- He is obviously above average intelligence 
- He has a deep understanding of the technology he is attacking and the parts he doesn't understand he researches in depth
- He is willing to put in huge amounts of time, to turn over every pebble and stone 
- He refuses to give in, and is incredibly persistent. He keeps going past the low hanging fruit and keeps digging and digging

Now this is for a person working independently with finite resources. Obviously money solves all these challenges because you can just hire people who possess all these qualities, en masse and that's what APTs do",lwavz2a,hacking

One of my favourites (a remote root in an appliance) was almost identical to a common CTF challenge, and I was quite surprised to find it in the wild, but the root shell was as useful as any other ;)

If you pick a particular type of application to specialize in, be that web applications, mobile, native apps, and you go look for bugs in applications of that type, eventually you will find one that nobody has found, and then you have a zero day. It sounds like I'm being facetious here, but it really is that 'simple'. The answer is really just 'those people are pretty good at hacking stuff, and they were doing something that led them to find a bug'. Sometimes its intentional research, sometimes its pentesters, sometimes its sysadmins or users finding stuff by accident.

I think I know the kind of mindset you're in though, and it's something that comes from spending a lot of time in 'curated' scenarios. There's a slight disconnect/jump from attacking stuff that somebody set up to be vulnerable and knowing that you're following a 'path', and going out there in the wild and doing it for 'real' (not that HTB etc isn't real, but you know what I mean). It's a combination of lack of experience - attacking a web browser is obviously a lot harder than vulnserver.exe - and, then, honestly, a lot of it is mental. Going up against a target you know isn't put there for you to hack is tiring/scary/intimidating. (For all of us - for me even now, sometimes, after a long session). That jump isn't as big as you think it is, though.

One thing that can help is target selection. Identify a methodology to find stuff that is more likely to be vulnerable, depending on your chosen area of interest. Probably you can't find a zero day in a web browser yet, that would be surprising. What binaries are running on your system that haven't had that much attention? Or if its web apps - you aren't going to RCE Wordpress Core. What about plugins? What about plugins with &lt;100 installs? What about other CMS's that aren't as hotly attacked? How can you identify applications you are more likely to succeed with, and move up from there?

To the extent that finding bugs is 'luck', successful intentional research is about choosing your luck :) This doesn't stop being the case with the big hard targets either - it just becomes 'which are the soft subsystems', 'where have mistakes likely been made' etc etc.",lwe4xll,hacking

That isn't correct, this hinges around how you understand ""to hack"" though.

The short version is that you need to understand some core ideas of computer architecture and organization (things like how machine code works, memory and memory management) in order to understand how to build exploits for memory corruption bugs which is the content Hacking: Art of Exploitation (AoE) is recommended for.

Back in 2003 when AoE was first published, this stuff made up a significant chunk of what hackers would be doing because it was everywhere. Twenty-one years later, programmers largely moved towards more secure languages (perhaps incidentally) and hacking has expanded to include a ton of new bug classes.

In general you want to understand how your target works in order to start really hacking on it. So to start you might learn about how web-apps are built and common issues there. This rarely rarely rarely gets into memory corruption and those sorts of low-level bugs. On the other hand if you wanted to target your operating system, then you'd want to have that computer architecture background knowledge because that is one of the hold outs that still uses the less secure languages and has bugs at that level.

So basically, it depends on what you want to hack.  Hacking doesn't require you learn that lower-level stuff, but there is a world of hacking that exists in that domain. Generally speaking, I do think having that lower-level understanding is a benefit to understanding the higher level but its not essential.",lvtl1yz,hacking

It was billed as “unhackable” as the NUA (network user address) was unspoofable and could be easily filtered out by the other end.

I’m not sure whether you can still get an actual X.25 network any more (used to be delivered over analogue copper).  Or an analogue modem could be used to connect to a gateway service called a PAD (packet assembler/dissassembler).  Sort of like a dialup ISP giving access to the network.

It still lives on as XOT (port 1998) and was until very recently available in some countries over the ISDN D channel (X.31). 

The higher level network stack could also be used over the IDSN B channel for point to point connections.

It’s so old now that last time I tried using it on a Cisco router, they had forgotten to include support for it.  The official advice was to upgrade to a higher feature set…

So even if something supports it, it’s very unlikely that it has been tested (or used) for a while.

so you would need to identify routers that specificaly have this type of process.  

im not sure if any network scanning tools have the ability to simply scan for TCP/XOT ports or packets. as the x.25 information is encapsulated in a TCP packet and therefor uses the TCP port.

Other arthropods also had compound eyes via phylogenetic bracketing, it's reasonable to assume they didn't *all* independently evolve the exact same eyes, but that their ancestor had them.

This is the Signor-Lipps effect and trilobites are hugely over-represented in the fossil record, since a trilobite could leave a fossil with every moult and we believe other arthropods didn't leave an intact moult. Easily 90% of all trilobite fossils are moults. A trilobite moult was three parts, the cranidium, shield (together the cephalon, but often disarticulated), and thorax+pygidium. In some trilobites, the thorax and pygidium disarticulated on moulting, but in most they didn't.

It’s crazy how radium was used for everything during this period.   The history on radium is sad.   The whole saga of the Radium Girls and the company that refused to acknowledge the damage is a hard read.   I recall reading radium was even marketed as an aid to men for some sexual deficiencies which was applied to one’s undercarriage or in the end.  I think they had radium enemas too.   If there was hole, people were putting it in there.

There’s probably something in my parent’s house somewhere like this.   Next to the Mercurochrome.   Radium was like the asbestos of the day.   Companies find something that works for one thing and they put the stuff on everything like it’s Franks Red Hot sauce.

As a person she was what you could call an ordinary person with common beliefs, wishes and acts that thanks to her position and exposition, made people around the world admire her. To many, comparing with the hollow and cold calculistic Queen and King, she was the hope that a voice could appear and put important matters in discussion, at the time like AIDS, Hunger in Africa (Live AID), Wars and etc, that politicians didn't want to address fearing the conservative and financial interests. She was a strong advocate for the ban on land-mines, exposing the consequences to children, that caused too many internal problems because the UK was a major seller of land-mines.

After her death, and because public pressure due many revelations made concerning Diana, her fight had a positive result: [The Ottawa agreement banning Land-Mines](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240112-princess-dianas-1997-landmine-walk-i-come-with-my-heart), that UK finally signed. She wasn't an absolute Kingdom or UK government trouble-maker, many times she was used in benefit of both. 

As a Woman, she surpassed Prince Charles role and attentions, for the first time the future king of England was ""Diana's +1"". Also as a Woman she had a voice, an independent voice from the husband, British Royalty and UK's Government. As a Woman she fought back a man, not an ordinary man, that man was a Prince and future King of the UK, and wasn't shy on pointing out his faults, showing the world to what she was subjected by the Queen, Prince and UK's governement. As a Mother she fought for her sons, refusing to let them go in favour of the roles in British Royalty.

She was an example to millions of women all over the world, that's why so many cried.

She had the looks and I can tell you that no picture makes justice to her beauty, only 1 painting for what I've seen, but it wasn't the looks alone, was her way of looking at people, the look that always showed how she was feeling at the time, how she managed to smile even if her world was a war, and her kindness.",lywh1vj,interestingasfuck

The world population at the time was only around 5.8 billion, and roughly 50-55% of people had access to a television. That means around 3-3.2 billion people could have even possibly watched the event. For the 2.5 billion number to be true, about 83% of everyone with a TV worldwide would have had to tune in, which is already pretty far-fetched.

Then there’s the issue of interest and practicality. While Queen Elizabeth II was an important figure, it’s unlikely that such a huge percentage of people outside of the Commonwealth nations would have cared enough to watch the funeral. Add in time zone differences and the fact that this was a live broadcast, and the number just doesn’t seem realistic. For comparison, the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final had about 1.5 billion viewers, and that was with way better global internet and TV access in a population of 8 billion.

It’s way more likely that the actual number was somewhere between 500 million to 1 billion viewers, which is still a huge audience but much more in line with other major global events from that era. The 2.5 billion claim feels like a major exaggeration when you factor in access, logistics, and general interest.",lyxe4vx,interestingasfuck

But it is the first recording of the **transition** between the states of the pendulum were achieved consistently. The hard part is figuring out how to get from the current state to the next state, while accounting for all the minute details that can cause a triple pendulum to behave chaotically. (Think butterfly effect)

[Here's another more recent, cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8vRJtQ-t3I) from them where they control the transition of a double pendulum with just rotation and swinging.

Where predicting the path of a double (or triple) pendulum is extremely difficult and in a non-theoretical environment almost impossible because of the sensitivity of the double pendulum to its starting conditions: i.e. even a tiny variation in the position will become a vast variation in the resulting path. 

However while the balancing at an individual moment by this computer controlled trolley is impressive, I am uncertain how it relates to the chaotic nature of the motion and suspect that might be editorialising but OP is welcome to correct me.  Is the algorithm correctly calculating the balance position and predicting the end state and how to stabilise the motion, or is it 'merely' (but still impressive) visually detecting the motion and providing an input energy and motion to 'capture' the pendulum.
