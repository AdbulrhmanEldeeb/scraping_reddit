https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1gy00bc,GPT-Claude-Gemini,2024-11-23,2024-11-23 16:00:03,3,3,0,0,"hey, founder of [jenova.ai](http://jenova.ai) here! this looks pretty interesting. we've actually been working on something similar with our AI model router system, specifically for coding tasks we route to Claude 3.5 Sonnet since its currently the best performing model for code generation and analysis.

one thing i noticed from our users is that they really value having multiple AI models available because different models excel at different aspects of coding. for example Claude is great at reasoning through complex logic and debugging, while GPT4 tends to be better at explaining code concepts.

quick suggestion - you might wanna consider adding some kind of model selection/routing capability to optimize for different coding tasks. Also maybe add real-time web search integration so developers can pull in latest documentation/stackoverflow discussions etc

btw if ur interested in testing different models performance for coding tasks, feel free to try out jenova ai - we made it free to use and you can directly compare how different models handle the same coding prompts

anyways cool project! looking forward to seeing how it develops 👍",lyldtyk,artificial

⬆️Feel free to check it out if you'd find it useful! It's a passion project I've been working on.

**At a glance:**

Writing Tools is an Apple Intelligence-inspired application for Windows and Linux that supercharges your writing with AI LLMs. It lets you fix up grammar and more with one hotkey press, system-wide. It's currently the world's most intelligent system-wide grammar assistant, and has been featured on [Beebom](https://beebom.com/high-schooler-app-brings-apple-inteligence-writing-tools-windows/), [XDA](https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-pc-can-now-deliver-instant-free-writing-help-across-all-apps/), [Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/news/this-small-app-brings-some-apple-intelligence-features-to-windows/), [and](https://tinhte.vn/thread/mang-apple-intelligence-len-windows-chay-gemini-1-5-flash-thong-minh-hon-ho-tro-san-tieng-viet.3840902/) [more](https://www.computer-wd.com/2024/10/new-computer-programs-to-try-now.html)!

Aside from being the only Windows/Linux program that works like Apple's Writing Tools:

* **Versatile AI LLM Support**: Jump in quickly with support for the **free Gemini API**, or use an extensive range of **local LLMs** (via Ollama, llama.cpp, KoboldCPP, TabbyAPI, vLLM, etc.) or **cloud-based LLMs** (ChatGPT, Mistral AI, etc.) with Writing Tools' OpenAI-API-Compatibility.
* **System-wide Functionality**: Works instantly in **any application** where you can select text. **Does not overwrite your clipboard**.
* **Completely free and Open-source**: No subscriptions, no hidden costs. Bloat-free &amp; uses pretty much **0% of your CPU**.
* **Chat Mode**: Invoke Writing Tools with no text selected to enter a chat mode for quick queries and assistance.
* **Privacy-focused**: Your API key and config files stay on *your* device. NO logging, diagnostic collection, tracking, or ads. Invoked *only* on your command. Local LLMs keep your data on your device &amp; work without the internet.
* **Supports Many Languages**: Works for any language! It can even *translate* text across languages better than Google Translate (type *""translate to \[language\]""* in ""Describe your change..."").
* **Code Support**: Select code and ask Writing Tools to work on it (fix, improve, convert languages) through ""Describe your change..."".
* **Themes, Dark Mode, &amp; Customization**: Choose between **2 themes**: a blurry gradient theme and a plain theme that resembles the Windows + V pop-up! Also has full **dark mode** support. **Set your own hotkey** for quick access.",ly34olm,artificial

So I mean I hopped around and eventually got my crutches and went back to class and I got written up for being late. I told the teacher what happened and she went to go check the cameras (I went with her) and I swear on my life bruh she saw it happen on the cameras and then she wrote me up and told me to ""be more aware of my surroundings""! 😭. a few days after that the same boy snuck up behind me at break and pushed me in the creek. It was a probably 4ish foot creek that was COMPLETELY green and full of algae, and frogs, and mud, and bacteria and all kinds of nasty stuff. MY ANKLE WAS STILL BROKEN TOO!! he thought he was so funny for pushing a crippled 6th grade girl into a green creek with frogs. My ankle hit a log thingy when I fell and I swear it hurt like HELL!! I was in so much pain that I didn't even think and I got up and kicked him in the balls (with my broken ankle 😭😭). After break I came back to class drenched from head to toe cause of the creek and everyone there told the teachers what happened and they gave me a week of detention for kicking him and absolutely nothing happened to him.... His mom was the vice principal tho so that's why. But ig he kinda got punished after cause he had like no friends after that. lol.

I think you have a very narrow scope of what an unreliable narrator book is. They're not all books like the ones everyone knows by Chuck P. and Agatha Christie. 


 I like the unreliable narrator trope where the characters sees the world one way, feels that the world perceives them a certain way, but their interaction with side characters clearly show otherwise. For example, when I asked for unreliable narrator books on r/suggestmeabook, the most popular answer was Lolita.

2) If you think having an unreliable narrator just means ""there's a twist where they lied!!!"" and that's the whole point you just haven't really read that many books with unreliable narrators.

Unreliable narrator can be: a liar, delusional, misguided, self deceiving, simply just not aware of all the facts!, limited in perspective, etc. etc. Knowing that a book has an unreliable narrator tells you basically nothing about the book, and proper literary experience lets you know if a narrator is unreliable within the first 10% of a book anyway, often on the first chapter lol.",lyo29pz,books

Then that next film of his was released, and beforehand it was well known there was a big twist. Took me all of 15 min to figure it out, since all I did was TRYING to figure it out. I did not enjoy that film at all, and I think the main reason was that I knew there was a twist so I didn’t just sit back and enjoy the storytelling.

But with unreliable narrators it can be fun trying to figure out the real story while it is happening.

On the one hand, I doubt you actually have much control over how you feel here. You enjoy being surprised when you read, and that's not a crime! But on the other hand, I do think you'd benefit from trying to reframe things. 

Maybe think of a more personal situation to try and see it from a new angle. Imagine you have a close friend/family member who's been single for ages, and you go a month without talking to them. At the end of that month, they tell you they've just gotten married to somebody they met in the pet food aisle at the grocery store.

Technically, the story of their relationship so far has been spoiled for you, but I highly doubt you'd just leave it at that. No, you'd want to know all the details of how the hell that happened. Wtf? Why did your loved one get married to someone who is basically a stranger in under a month? What exactly has their new spouse done to convince them that's a good idea? Have they gone insane?

Use **one record per customer** only if you’re okay with losing those month-to-month dynamics.

**Option 1: One record per customer per month**

This is what I’d recommend for churn prediction, especially in a subscription model where customer behavior often shifts leading up to a churn event. Here’s how it would work:

	•	For every customer, create a record for **each month** in your 12-month window.

	•	The features in each record would describe the customer’s state in **that specific month** (e.g., monthly spend, engagement, complaints, subscription tier, etc.).

	•	Label the record as “churn = 1” if the customer churns in the **next month**, and “churn = 0” otherwise.

For example:

	•	A customer who didn’t churn at all in 12 months would have 12 rows, all labeled churn = 0.

	•	A customer who churned in March would have rows for January and February labeled churn = 0 and the row for February labeled churn = 1 (since they churned in March).

**Why it’s great:**

	1.	**You capture temporal trends**: The model can pick up on patterns like “engagement dropped 3 months before churn.”

	2.	**More data**: This approach gives you more training samples, which can improve performance, especially if churn is rare.

	3.	**Behavior snapshots**: You’re giving the model the ability to understand how behavior changes month to month.

**Challenges:**

	•	You’ll need to carefully create features for each customer-month record (like making sure you’re not leaking future data).

	•	The dataset can get big—imagine 1M customers with 12 records each!

**Option 2: One record per customer**

Here, you just summarize the customer’s data into a single record for the entire 12 months (or just use their state from the most recent month). For customers who churned, you’d include features up to the month before they churned.

Example:

	•	Customer who didn’t churn → one row summarizing their last 12 months.

	•	Customer who churned in March → one row summarizing their data as of February.

**Why it’s simpler:**

	1.	**Easier to manage**: No need to deal with month-to-month snapshots.

	2.	**Fewer rows**: The dataset is smaller, so training is faster and easier.

**But it has downsides:**

	•	You lose **temporal information**, which can be super important for churn. A customer gradually disengaging over time is a common precursor to churn, and this structure won’t capture that.

**What I’d recommend:**

Use **Option 1** if you want your model to pick up on **behavioral trends over time**. This is especially useful in a subscription business where churn is influenced by changes in engagement, usage, etc. Use **Option 2** only if you’re pressed for simplicity or don’t have monthly-level data.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have follow-up questions or need help with feature engineering or handling class imbalance (since most customers don’t churn). 🚀",lz0h7z7,datascience

That’s no small feat, especially in today’s competitive job market. Both roles sound interesting, but since you’re leaning toward the AI Engineer position, let me break it down for you and explain why I think that’s the better choice for your long-term growth.

1. Future-Proofing Your Career: The AI Engineer role focuses on building large language models (LLMs), which are at the cutting edge of tech right now. AI and machine learning are rapidly growing fields, and having hands-on experience with LLMs will put you in a strong position to capitalize on this trend. Even if you decide to shift roles later, having “AI Engineer” and experience with LLMs on your resume will open a lot of doors.
2. Transferable Skills: The technical expertise you gain in an AI Engineer role will be highly transferable across industries. Whether you decide to stay in tech, pivot to research, or even move into applied areas like healthcare or finance, this role sets a solid foundation. Plus, technical skills often command higher salaries and better opportunities over time.
3. Workplace Interaction: I totally understand your hesitation about the fully remote aspect, especially since you value in-person interactions. But many remote roles still have ways to build community—team meetings, virtual hangouts, or even periodic offsite events. Plus, you can balance this by joining local meetups or communities related to your field. The independence you gain from remote work could also help you grow personally and professionally.
4. Career Titles Matter (Early On): In the early stages of your career, job titles can make a big difference. “AI Engineer” has more technical prestige and tends to carry more weight when you’re looking to make your next move. “Marketing Scientist,” while valuable, might pigeonhole you into a niche that’s harder to pivot out of later.
5. The Stats + Data Science Angle: With your background in statistics and modeling, the AI Engineer role aligns better with the skills you’ve been building. You’ve already mentioned that you’ve done projects and internships in data science—this is your chance to take those skills to the next level. While the Marketing Scientist role sounds client-facing and analytical, it might not challenge or stretch your technical abilities in the same way.

Lastly, remember that while workplace interactions are important, the growth opportunities you get early in your career can have a bigger impact in the long run. You can always seek out networking and social opportunities outside of work, but getting your foot in the door of a cutting-edge field like AI doesn’t come around every day.

Go for the AI Engineer role—you’ll thank yourself a few years down the line! Best of luck, and congrats again! 🎉",lz0iumj,datascience

 i found some masters that offer them to any major, but upon calling them they told me the process is harder if you dont have the degree on mathematics or computer science areas. its a very respectful university in europe, so i am wondering: what are my chances like? i am going to apply anyways but i wanted to see if anyone here tried making a similar move and if you have any advice for it. how was it like for you? what did you add to your application that you felt made a difference?
also, any recommendations for really good certificates (even if paid) that could make me stand out as someone who can keep up with the program just as well? i am planning this not for immediate jump, i think its too early, but for the near future. so plans for the long run are very welcomed!!!

Data Science embedded in the business is very useful. Centralised data teams can lack the business understanding and they can be a big bottleneck, time-wose. From my own experience, central teams can also add to the bureaucratic overhead (""Yes, we'd very like to support you. But go ahead and please fill out these documents on the goal and expected value of your project, and we'll try to find some time to discuss your proposal and get back to you."" 😉). 


On the other hand, central teams are often good for the more structured(?) support like maintenance.


You already mentioned your pain points:  


- limited exposure of your work


- limited advancement opportunities 


- unclear responsibilities of the team (""do you maintain other people's crappy models?""). 


These would be points to take up with your boss (or even their boss, depending on your relationships). They'll also see that other teams have more of the first two, and that they might lose you to the business teams if your expectations are not met to a satisfying degree.",lxl2z7p,datascience

The business may not trust you to deliver or cater to their needs. To change this you need to act more like a consultant internally. 

One thing I often see is that analytics/it does not communicate well with the business. For example, at my current client the analytics team is invited to meetings with our stakeholders and doesn’t show up to the meetings. The stakeholders do and of course they feel like we are listening to them and delivering on their needs and notice that analytics/it is noticeably absent from these meetings. 

One way to quickly build credibility is to work with the consultants in delivery and take credit for their work. They are probably happy to have you do this. The more they can be seen as playing nice in the org the better for them. If things go wrong blame the consultants. It’s what we are there for. 

Along this same line I recently tried to give credit to the IT/analytics org and the refused to take it! In fact they were upset that I wanted to co-present at the sprint demo 😂. Once again who will the business see delivering? Us.

- try other scalers
- try double scaling lol
- augmentations and resampling, synthetic data
- evaluate different metrics. There are many with imbalance in mind
- collect more data, esp. Minority
- consider a ""maybe"" label (ternary classification)
- feature selection, dimensionality reduction, examine collinearity
- cleaner data
- enhance with outside data sources; consider pretraining
- bigger cross validation
- see if you can collect different signals or more relevant features
- audit the data collection and ingestion processes
- try different seeds lol
- remove outliers
- try an anomaly detection paradigm
- I was toying with the idea of inlier selection with ransac for individual trees the other day
- see what an automl library comes up with; maybe you'll get some ideas
- iterate more in feature engineering
- experiment with different categorical encodings
- see if you can improve the whole pipeline somehow
- can you make your model significantly faster than what's in production w/o sacrificing too much? If it can't predict faster or with less memory, can we retrain faster?
- can we look at drift detection and redeployment strategies?
- deal with missing data
- think about hardware
- take a look at cluster analysis. Maybe identify niches and train different models for them
- maybe look at where the heuristic model tends to fail and identify or detect those conditions so you could only run inference when the label isn't 'obvious' heuristically
- see if there are better ways of serving your model. If it's more expensive than the heuristics, maybe only serve it on off-peak hours or whenever it could have the best business impact
- question the business case to make sure you aren't solving a non-problem
- examine column dtypes. You can go lighter and faster with appropriate downcasts or maybe you notice you sacrificed too much precision or something
- if you can't improve the results themselves, maybe polish the presentation of your results
- try dimensionality reduction on subsets, like maybe the least important features
- update your dependencies
- calibration
- compare results to a RF on your top 3 features (instead of a dummy stump)
- ask a mentor or colleague for advice/ideas/insight/code review
- hand-label a few samples to get 'psychologically closer' to your data
- stratify your splits
- consider additional stratification by an important categorical or binned continuous
- consider what other useful business insights are in your data. Maybe your model can actually be a multi label classifier, which might justify the increased cost

For example, if it takes more than a day to build a new environment, you'll never get there 😉

You're 'the only person doing DevOps' and your managers feel that systems need to be 'monitored' for changes to config/services. Now, keep in mind that your managers may not be technically inclined, and they may very well be asking for the wrong thing 😉

However, going from experience, if they're asking you this, it is because of a desire to be 'more in control' of what happens on these systems. The objective: make change predictable, and improve availability/stability. Which is a great objective to have, but not something I'd solve with any kind of 'monitoring' solution. Check with your manager what they are trying to achieve, and whether it is what I'm suggesting here. This will also help you not waste a crap ton of time on something that \_will\_ monitor VMs for changes, but will do nothing to prevent or correct the resulting outage.

So how to navigate this? Well, we could go through a complete re-architecture of everything, and other commenters have already taken a head start in that direction. But if this thread is starting out because you're looking for help in implementing your managers' suggestion for 'monitoring', I don't think changing architectures is within your mandate.

Instead, we have 50+ VMs that we currently consider 'uncontrolled' environments. And we would like to change that. In order to get something that both works, keeps working, \_and\_ doesn't blow up other things in the landscape, you need to figure out a few things:

1. Who owns these VMs? This seems like a simple question, but it might not be. Is your team (or you, as the DevOps person) creating and managing these VMs? Is there another (infra/OS) team involved that manages 'the base system'? If it's just your team, that's great, because you're not potentially going to break someone else's stuff at some point 😉 If there \_is\_ an infra/OS team managing stuff, start by having a chat with them. They may have things in place (e.g. Ansible or Puppet) that you can leverage.
2. How are changes to 'your VMs' made, and who is making the changes? Let's figure out how the current situation works. Ask your team, if necessary perform some archeology. Are developers logging into systems and manually changing things? Is there deployment tooling (like XL Deploy or RunDeck) performing changes? Etcetera. Getting 'in control' will eventually mean 'controlling how things are changed'. Knowing your stakeholders/target audience and the current way of working will help you not just in coming up with a solution, but also in making sure your solution gets a 'graceful landing' in your organization. This is absolutely key if your solution also involves 'taking root permissions away from people' 😉
3. What is the level of capability in your team? You may come up with an amazing solution, but if nobody knows how to use it or gets frustrated with it, you have just become a single point of failure. Best case it means 'infinite job security', worst case it means burnout or people simply working around your solution. Also leverage your managers if you find that your team is reluctant or unable to adopt automation for system config changes (it happens, a lot). In the end your managers (probably) want to achieve 'being in control' of the environments, and automation is by far the best solution for it. If your team lacks knowledge to do so, management can arrange for proper training. If your team doesn't want to use automation, management can offer the alternative (which is basically 'death by processes' 😛 ). Politics or knowledge management aren't yours to deal with, use your managers for that.

Now in terms of tech, let's look at options; not architecture. I would \_always\_ pick immutable infrastructure in 2024, but that's not what you have. So what you're looking for is a means of managing the desired state of long-lived, mutable systems, as code. A.k.a. Configuration Management Tooling. Over the past 2 decades there have been many successful solutions for this purpose. Today, Ansible probably has the most traction, although its propensity to become 'dirty Bash scripts wrapped in YAML' is something I dislike about it. But it does get the job done, and it's \_very\_ actively being backed by IBM/RedHat to the point of them applying it as the solution for everything.

Another solution I've used quite a bit (but over a decade ago -- even though it still exists today) is Puppet. Puppet ticks all the boxes in the sense that it's not just a solid solution for Config Management (or 'desired state as code') with the option of storing that code in Git, and moving back to previous versions, etc; but it also offers options for quickly gathering intel across your environment (e.g. 'which VMs run an OpenSSL version lower than X?'), or monitoring changes. The ability to quickly 'query our environment' proved helpful quite often; especially when management would panic over some vulnerability they read about on the internet 😉 We used to have dashboards (for management) and alerts (for us) to keep track of issues or illegal changes.

But whichever tech solution you choose, make sure to go through steps 1 to 3 first, so you don't end up breaking another team's work, your own team's work, or building someone that your peers can't effectively use.",lyyhmkx,devops

* https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/

&gt;We pretty quickly ran into issues like me needing to deploy something to prod, but the commits from the other dev would be included as well, but his wasn't approved/tested yet.

This breaks the golden rule of trunk based development (TBD) that you never commit code to the main branch that breaks the integration tests.

In your situation, the scaled variant of TBD might work better for you, where the incomplete work of another developer sits on a short-lived feature branch (see doc above ""Scaled Trunk Based Development""). Tools like Github Actions and Jenkins can integrated into Github PR workflows to prevent untested code being merged to main branch. You can also add merge approvals. This complex overhead is more typical of larger teams sharing a common codebase.

&gt;Again we have dev, test and prod. But dev is equal to prod. So you start branch from dev, do your stuff, merge into test. When it's tested merge into prod and dev and close the branch.

Now, let's address environments. If you stand back from Git, what do you use environments for? To run different *versions* of your code at the same time. For example:

* **Integration (Dev)**: runs the latest code built from ""main"" branch.
* **Test**:  runs the latest release: 1.24.0
* **Production**: runs the release last approved by test: 1.23.4

So, what is a release? Instead of branches in Git, think of release management as a conveyer belt in a factory. The ""release"" is a thing created in development and passed to test as a candidate for production. Only the good releases are approved and passed onto production. (Test might find a problem and demand a new patched version of the code). Releases are a linear progression of your code's capabilities. Branching is a dev construct to facilitate parallel work.

So, ideally, a ""release"" should be something created from the source code. This explains why we use tags in git to pin the source code at a point in time. This pinned code is then used to build file(s) that are used for deployment to a target environment.
For example:  

* Docker image + Helm chart, stored in a Docker registry.
* Java war file, stored in Artifactory
* Compressed tarball (myapp-1.24.0.tar.gz), stored in a shared directory 😀

Lastly, if you reject this packaging nonsense and just want to deploy directly from Git, then do this deployment from tags (fixed snapshot of your code in time), not branches.

A branch is a series of changes to a set of files that represents their evolution over time. A branch is not an environment. Keeping this straight in your head steers you away from a lot of problems.

So if the idea is dev ➙ test ➙ prod… why do you have three branches? That’s one single series of changes. You need one branch, not three.

&gt; We pretty quickly ran into issues like me needing to deploy something to prod but the commits from the other dev would be included as well, but his wasn't approved/tested yet.

If they weren’t approved / tested then they shouldn’t have been merged. Keep your master branch deployable at all times.

&gt; Again we have dev, test and prod. But dev is equal to prod. So you start branch from dev, do your stuff, merge into test. When it's tested merge into prod and dev and close the branch.

This sounds like a huge mess. Dev and prod are the same? Then why have them both? You merge *from* test *into* dev? That’s backwards!

It sounds like you have very little experience in Git but you’re trying to invent your own workflow. Why? You haven’t described anything that needs a unique workflow nobody else has done before, and you lack the experience to come up with something sensible. Use something that already exists, like TBD, instead of reinventing the wheel badly.",lyux8m7,devops

* https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/databases

The idea is that the vault generates a temporary leased credential, given a certain role, to access the database. Since each credential has a time to live (TTL), it naturally takes care of all the usual problems associated with password revocation and rotation. 
Vault has an API that can be used to extend the lease on an issued credential, and for production, this feature can be used by your application's connection pool. 

Sadly, this approach tends to scare developers and DBAs 😔
The more conservative approach is to integrate the database with an Enterprise SSO solution.
Sadly, this is not universally available and does not address credential rotation for service accounts... (oh no, did I let the cat out of bag? 😉)

Hope this helps

**PS**

Coincidentally found this project today, which might simplify the use of dynamic database credentials on Kubernetes.

1. ArgoCD manages itself so the initial ApplicationSet gets created when Argo is deployed (the only thing that has to be deployed manually initially, but then there's an app for itself so Argo manages itself)
2. We use only helm charts for whatever we need
3. Well-defined folder structure, e.g.:

production

└── apps

└── app1

development

└── apps

└── app1  
4. Git + Matrix generator so ArgoCD detects automatically when there's a new/updated app

5. Each environment folder (production/development) has its own cluster config file that defines where ArgoCD has to deploy the apps to (part of the ApplicationSet generators)  
6. Each environment has its own project in Argo (we migrated from Master ArgoCD + Child ArgoCDs to Master ArgoCD only architecture)

So you need to find something that grabs your brain and makes your heart race and makes you want to say ""Imma gonna go do that!!"" 

Some people get that hook early in life.  Others, it takes awhile.  

Don't freak out that you haven't figured it out yet.

Try to experience stuff, talk to people, read up on things, doomscroll through youtube...look for anything that makes you think, 'ya, I gotta do that!'

And find a path to get there.

As for successful people, or those who you think are successful...if you can...ask them how they got to where they are.  Successful people weren't always successful.  They tried and failed at things you have no idea how many times. But they managed to get up and go try again.

Success is the difference between amateurs and professionals.

Amateurs focus on goals. Professionals focus on habits. (someone on the internet said that).

Have habits that allow you to see and understand the world around you, and that will lead to more positive outcomes.  

Good habits get you goals.",lz18rrb,GetMotivated

I just went through a gnarly divorce with 3 kids. I didn’t lie to them, but didn’t blame their mom or tell them what an absolute demon she was being. I blamed “the court” for why I couldn’t see them instead of their mom. Don’t fight in front of them, don’t badmouth their mom. The truth will come out at some point when they’re older I’m sure, but right now they’re just kids trying to deal with their world blowing up. Mine are about the ages of yours and it was really hard on them. CONSTANTLY show them love and reassure them that they didn’t do anything wrong. My middle one struggled with blaming himself and it killed me. My youngest (4) doesn’t really get it. My oldest (10) has a lot of anger. It’s just part of it. 

As far as surviving it, I went to the gym. A lot. Got real fuckin strong lol and had a few close friends as confidants and moral support. That will carry you through a lot. 

Not sure if yours will be nasty or not, but mine got bad almost immediately. Things didn’t turn in my favor until I stopped trying to be the nice guy and stopped trying to do it amicably. For months I tried to be reasonable and not do anything rash, just be fair and go our separate ways. She did the opposite. She went after everything including the kids. I finally told my lawyer to go scorched earth, rescind all offers and take everything. Now I have 50/50 custody, which is all I cared about in the first place. Gave up just about everything else so I could be in my kids lives, but it took taking the gloves off to get there. Don’t be afraid to go for the throat if it comes to it.

Try to frequent an area of interest, whether it's a school club, cafe, or some community (could be sports too). Through being forced into interactions, it does help connect with others. In terms of finding a balance between putting yourself out there and people pleasing, I think that you have to just try your best to be yourself without necessarily placing too much pressure on yourself to have others like you. Things like being a good listener, showing interest(genuinely) and just showing up are pretty much all you need to build a circle lol. I'm not making guarantees but this would be a start.

Being secure in yourself comes with understanding and accepting yourself. Accepting the person you are today,  the decisions you made in the past and what came with that. Developing yourself mentally, physically, or even spiritually can definitely boost your self esteem, but really you want to be able to accept yourself with or without some huge change in your life. I practically use a stoic approach to find peace in what was and what is. Change takes time. The fact you want to move forward in life is commendable, and as long as you can keep trying, be willing to fail, and get up again, im sure you'll find progress in your journey.

Since then I talked to people and even coached some people at my work. Here's what I found: 
1. people do not know basic stuff until somebody is the first one to tell them. 
2. Once they know it, there is a constant influx of new (young and old) users that have not yet heard the 'obvious' thing. 
3. If you are into something (for you it's fitness, for me home organisation and interior design) you are in the bubble of 'knowers', but not everyone is in that bubble and you might become their introduction/ guide.
4. I watch, read and listen to lots of content about interior design and home organisation even though I already know what the creator will most likely highlight. People love to be reassured on one hand, surprised with a small bit of new info they have not heard before on the other AND if they disagree they live to comment their own findings, opinions and even studies you might not have heard about before, so it's also a learning opportunity for the creator. 
5. Some creators have boring content knowledge -wise, but they present it in a way that is entertaining, inspiring or drive the basic point home better. That is why we consume this content. If knowledge was all people wanted we would not have thousands of channels showing a closet reorganisation ideas and hundreds more with kitchen declutter process and 'how to pick curtains'. 

BTW I know how to pick curtains, do you? It's the most basic of basics and repeated so many times surely everyone would have perfectly curated window treatments, but do they? 😉",lymbvuk,GetMotivated

- my pet beetles. it was incredibly important to me that I cleaned my depression cave before they arrived, I dont want to attract any bugs that could crawl in and harm my beetles, so I needed to make sure my space was clean first. I'm starting to eat healthier because im already preparing veggies for my pets anyways, and they wont finish a whole pack of spinach or a whole zucchini before it goes bad, so I might as well have some too. it's also very grounding to watch them crawl around, something I can rely on to make me smile

- nearly completely pushing away my friends because I was so disconnected from myself and my actions that I didnt recognize that I was hurting them. I'm really glad that I started feeling like myself again, and that I was able to recognize what I was doing and start repairing those relationships.

- passing out because of an anxiety attack i had while high and alone. my friends and my mom had told me that I should take a break from weed but I didnt listen, and it started becoming something that I would hide, then be ashamed of, and it really started impacting my mental health.

I can tell that I'm starting to heal, and I'm starting to accept that it's going to take longer than I want to get where I want to be, I'm trying to be okay with that. it kills me that I cant be that person now, but those habits will be more sustainable if they're slowly built and worked on, rather than if I were to just through myself into a new life like I've tried so so many times before.

Scary Hour is an hour where I do things I need to get done that I’ve been dreading, that I’ve been putting off, or are anxiety-inducing in some way. Usually for me that’s things like reading and replying to emails and messages, making phone calls, paying bills, etc. I’ve made sure to set the parameters for myself that Scary Hour ONLY lasts an hour, no matter what, and I can ONLY do Scary Things during it. If you’ve got tasks that are going to take longer than an hour, I’d recommend breaking them down into smaller tasks so that you can have some to fully complete in that hour - I’d recommend breaking them down anyway, but especially if you’re making them Scary Hour tasks.

The key for me is that I hype myself up in the few minutes beforehand and then once it starts, I just GO on the tasks without giving myself time in between to think about whatever it is that makes them scary. Somehow having the rules do Scary Hour in place makes that a little easier, but I definitely acknowledge that just telling your anxiety “nope, I don’t have time for you” and pushing through is easier said than done. I sort of think of it like making impulsivity work for me - I see or think of the task and JUMP into doing it without thinking it through. Sometimes doing a “1, 2, 3, GO” countdown in my head helps, but often I use “Come on Barbie, let’s go party” as my countdown lol.

Also, I’m often a lot more successful with this if I tell a friend I’m doing it and send them an update at the end, or sometimes they join in and do their own Scary Hour at the same time. Sometimes we do this on a video call, like not chatting or anything but just having the call up while we both work, or sometimes just knowing someone is doing it at the same time is helpful!

Oh, and having a little reward at the end :) I’m not very good at rewarding myself, either I give in early or don’t follow through, so sometimes I’ll have a friend or someone help out. So for example, I ask my friend to send me some cute pictures of her kids or to find a few funny memes for me to have *only* when I’ve finished. Or if there’s something I want to tell her/talk about, I’ll say/text that I really want to tell them about XYZ but only after I’m done with a task or Scary Hour.",lxxln1y,GetMotivated

Haha.

Ok, to be serious, what gets me out of bed and what is motivating me currently are thoughts of my future. 

I want a wife and I want to be the best wife that I can be. Right now, I'm doing everything I can to prepare my mind, body, and finances for her and our future family. One day, my dreams will be a reality and what a sweet, sweet day that will be. That thought fuels me.

Also, waking up alive is a great motivator. I've seen death in my life and traveled to a few countries and it has taught me how life is such a gift.  The fact that I have another day to get out there and enjoy this world, love people, pursue my dreams, and be alive excites me.

What gets my rear up at 5:30am is that I have a PT test that I can't fail. I also want to be strong, capable, and able.

Man. Thank you Op, this question rocks, and I've been able to put my ""why"" into words. I'm all pumped up now. 

&gt;There was a time when my motivation was all about my career, like climbing the ladder and proving I could do it. It worked for a bit, but I started feeling like something was missing. That’s when I realized I needed something more personal to keep me grounded.

I feel you so much on this. I was there to.. I realized that I was working way to many hours and was also super serious about the work. I've had to work on taking a breath and having fun,  and enjoying all these people around me. I have a Momento Mori Amor Fati flag above my door to remind me. It says to me ""Remember to live because one day you will die. Remember my death so that I make the most of my days now.""

When you accomplish that first small goal it gives you momentum to keep moving forward. You also gain a ton of confidence along the way because you see what you can do.
