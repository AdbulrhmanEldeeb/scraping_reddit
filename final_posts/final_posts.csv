artificial,Introducing NexAI: An AI-Powered Web Framework 🚀,"Hey everyone! 👋

I’ve been working with my team on something that I think could make a big difference for developers – **NexAI**, an AI-powered web framework that helps take care of the boring, repetitive code so you can focus on the creative stuff. 🚀

Here’s what NexAI does:

✅ **Multi-LLM support**  
✅ **Component prompts as doc strings**  
✅ **Boilerplate code retrieval**  
✅ **Full codebase context**  
✅ **Continuous refactoring with terminal commands**

I’m curious, how do you feel about the current state of web development tools? Do you ever find yourself spending too much time on repetitive tasks or boilerplate code? I wanted to build something that helps free up your time so you can focus on the fun parts of coding.

I’d love to hear your thoughts! Do you think something like NexAI could be useful? Any suggestions or features you’d like to see? Let’s chat! 😎

They each have a different role - setting the narrative, maintaining consistency, researching plot points...

You can follow their progress through GitHub commits and watch them work in real-time 🤯”

I clicked to read the comments hoping to see her getting absolutely roasted but 9/10 of the comments are about how cool and awesome this is. 

I know this has been discussed here before and I think most of us look down on the idea but I guess I want to know what people think about how this shift will be received by people in general. Are people going to be excited to read AI books? Will it destroy the industry? Should a book be forced to have a disclaimer on the cover if it was AI written? Would that even make a difference in people’s reading choices?

books,None of this is true - spoilers,"Okay I know it's not a new book but I just finished ""none of this is true"" by Lisa Jewell and want to talk about it!

First off I had the audio book which was amazing! The format of the book worked so well with audio book that I honestly can't imagine actually reading it. The cast did a great job too, especially the one little part from Brookes mother. It made the whole thing feel so real, like I was going to hear about Josie on the news. 

Secondly and most importantly... WTF. Who do you believe? I know the title but what is true?! Like part of me believes Josie but the thing that makes it hardest for me is the way they found Walter and Erin. Josie just kind of writes it off as ""after that I didn't remember what happened"" and paints herself as a victim (of course, it's her whole MO) where as Erin's side makes more sense to how they were found but she colors Walter so angelic. Also can't remember if it was Erin or Roxy but one of them says Walter skyped with his sons in Canada secretly but the one part from the son says he hasn't spoken to Walter since he was a child and moved. I kind of wonder if Brooke was Roxy and Walter/Erin were Josie? A friend who read it said they didn't believe anything from Josie because of what the girls and Pat said about her but I've seen bitter nasty abusers absolutely trash people with lies before, things similar to what we're said about Josie. So for me that casts doubt on their testimonies. She denies all of it but fesses up to Nathan. I don't know, I'm rambling at this point.

books,"Can't believe I'm saying this, but the show was better...","Drawn in by the absolute masterpiece the Netflix show was, I went chasing the terrifying world in the book, **The Haunting of Hill house** by Shirley Jackson that inspired it 

As a fanatical, (sometimes infatuated) reader, I never thought I'd say the words; ""the show was better than the book"" 

My apologies to those who liked the book, because this rant is armed on a poisoned tipped spear 

*The good*


Spooky atmosphere and setting. I did not find this book particularly frightening, but it did a good job building a scary ambiance. An inanimate protagonist, the house, is a refreshing idea that sparks imagination 

*The bad*


Outdated and dull. The writing definitely showed its age in sentence structure and vocabulary. (But hey I learned new words. *Biddy* and *Bosomy*) 

Did I mention it was not scary? It read more like an itinerary than a horror plot. ""we walked through a place and it was cold"" kind of thing. ""We saw a statue with a mean face"". 

*The ugly*


~~terrible~~ Abysmal character development. With the exception of Mrs Dudley, the lack of interesting characters ruined this piece of literature. Everyone's personalty seemed over-simplistic, over-dramatic and down right cartoony. 


I'm convinced Disney got inspiration from Mrs Montague to write Cinderella's lady Tremaine. 

Did anyone catch how inconceivable the first character introductions were? Theodora and Eleanor's first meeting came straight out of a ages 3+ book. Bundled ""yay we're besties"" and ""let's go on a picnic"" 

Luke Sanderson? Ahh let's greet and treat him with sarcasm because he's opened up his house to us in full hospitality 

Let's get into: 

*The ridiculous*


Scare reactions. Who- pardon my french- the fuck laughs when they're being haunted? Who the fuck Cracks sarcastic jokes when there is a ghost knocking your door at 3am and you're feeling the chill of terror? Who giggles when you've just held a spectral hand?

Theodora and Eleanor do! 

It's hard to take a horror book seriously when there's a ""-Theodora laughed"" at the end of a sentence. These 30 something year old women were at times written like midddle-schoolers and at other times like divorced 50 somethings 

I am fully aware of the argument, ""the house made em act like that"" but if the characters weren't afraid, why should I as the reader be? 

Just because a book helped influencing an entire horror genre, doesn't mean the book itself is good. I was yearning, HOPING, Shirley Jackson was going to turn things around in the last chapter... but no. She crashed it 😉

books,i finally finished “frankenstein” and i’m mad at myself ,"it’s ironic that the book i was supposed to finish in high school (almost TEN years ago) and dnf’d three times in the last 2 years, not only ended up being 4.25 ⭐️ but also being book 100 for 2024. wow.

i was the kid growing up who read every single book in all of their classes—even the ones that weren’t required. but “frankenstein” was that ONE book i just decided to skip. i used sparksnotes for my exam too 😭😭 god, forgive me for my sins 😭

it’s also funny to me because i actually had never made it past the first letter/chapter. it had always failed to capture my attention. i don’t know what happened this time around but i decided to give it another shot. i’m so glad i did. though in hindsight, i think it was “the phantom of the opera” that put me in the PERFECT mood to try out “frankenstein” again.

i’m a sucker for gothic literature. now i see why this is the most recommended one. the writing was superb, suspenseful and just vivid. it captured the feelings of creator and creation so perfectly. i was not expecting this much depth on philosophy, on life, creation, etc. and the fact that the writing style was so approachable was just the cherry on top!

the first third of the book is largely written in a series of letters from walton to his sister. then, the narrative shifts (kind of like a story within a story) and victor frankenstein begins telling us the reader about his background. there was so much suspense there. 

the 2nd third was mostly from the monster’s perspective (so a story within a story within a story 💀). but i didn’t particularly care for this section. i feel like it put the brakes on the pacing of the story. there wasn’t any suspense. while i appreciate the fact that we got to understand the monster more, i just feel like it interrupted the flow of the story. it was very abrupt. this is also where the writing became more clunky and convoluted. it is the section that made me knock down the rating to 4.25 ⭐️ 

what i loved the most about this style of narration is that each character (walton, frankenstein, the monster) had their own voice. everyone could stand on their own. no one sounded the same. it was a better experience than the characters in “dracula” (which i still loved), who kinda all sounded the exact same. 

so this is a lesson to all the folks who didn’t read the books they were supposed to for school—read that book now. who knows? you might be missing out 🤷🏾‍♀️",trailofglitter_,https://reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtpntf/i_finally_finished_frankenstein_and_im_mad_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gtpntf/i_finally_finished_frankenstein_and_im_mad_at/,2024-11-17 22:34:07,173,0.82,173,0,61,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,self,
careerguidance,wtf should I do with my English degree?,"(Skip to the third paragraph if you want to avoid my sob story.)

Admittedly I didn’t take college as seriously as I should have, plus the whole pandemic thing…But almost 2 years ago I graduated with a BA in English, minor in writing, pretty good GPA (3.6 iirc). Did an internship in the library archives (research, writing, creating content for library displays), and had involvement in the student literary magazine and English club.

Since I graduated I’ve been working part time (~30/week) as bus monitor making minimum wage. I love my job, love the company, the kids are hilarious. I rent with roommates, and have a pretty simple lifestyle. No debt. Single. Childfree. I can technically live off of what I make. But this place we rent is a mouse infested piece of shit, and the landlord is an old dick to deal with. I have savings, but I need to make more money to comfortably save up enough to move out and buy a small house. That’s my goal. 

I’ve been applying for different jobs and struggling to figure out other jobs that I would be good at. Other than like…content writer or customer service representative roles…I can’t think of anything else. Does anyone have any suggestions? Preferably something with a little bit of room to “move up the ladder,” but truthfully I’m not too ambitious. Just want to make enough to live.

careerguidance,How should I negotiate this promotion to a full time position?,"Upstate NY, USA

I (30F) have been really hustling these past few years to get where I am and I am very proud of the progress I’ve made in my career, but now my hard work is paying off and I don’t know how best to move forward. I have a BFA in theatre (lol), but after years of working as a performance artist and supplementing my income with restaurant jobs, I realized that path wasn’t sustainable. I wanted stability, better pay, and benefits.

So, I taught myself graphic design and started building up a client base. Over time, I’ve worked on projects across all kinds of industries— building websites for various verticals from medical and aesthetics businesses to B2B clients, plus designing beer labels and book covers.

I leveraged my graphic design skills to land a job as a Content Manager for a successful international business that focuses on coaching sales techniques and career development for public speakers. It started as a part-time gig at $25 an hour, averaging 22 hours a week, though some weeks have stretched to almost 60 hours (not including travel time to other cities). The hours are flexible, 80% of the work can be done remotely, and the office is within walking distance of my home. The job does require significant travel quarterly, and may even involve travel out of state and potentially out of the country. 

The team is mostly international, with members in Canada and the UK. My boss and I are one of 5 emoloyees based in the US, and we live in a small town of about 5,000 people, and where we live is definitely a high cost of living area. My boss is a recent transplant to the town (hence how I stumbled upon the position), and I have lived here for several years. Because of this, I’ve taken on some in-person assistant tasks, as their PA isn’t local.

Recently, I was offered the chance to transition to full-time, which would include a salary, health insurance, a 401(k) matching, and other benefits—all things I’ve never had before. While I’m tempted to accept, I’m hesitant because I don’t know how much more work it will add or what salary to ask for. I was initially thinking of asking $75k, but after talking to others, I’m considering $105k, but that feels like an absurdly massive jump. I do have a tendency to under value my work, which I know is pretty vital to the company now, so I feel like I need an outside perspective here. As someone who has been on the hiring side in this town, I know for a fact that the candidate pool in my area isn’t exactly bursting with people who are both qualified and seeking employment. I feel confident that my position is secure no matter how I respond to their offer.

On top of that, I just passed my real estate salesperson exam! I don’t know how much energy I want to put into that career path. I got the license to act as the agent for my fiancé with small real estate investments, but I also know there’s serious money to be made in real estate if you hustle. The question is whether I’ll have the bandwidth to do it all, and I need to find a broker who understands my position and commitments. 

So here’s where I’m stuck: My five year goal has been to make it to a six figure annual income, but I also value a healthy work-life balance and don’t want to be burnt out all the time. My design work brings me so much joy and pride, and I really don’t want to give it up. My boss has been incredibly supportive of both my design business and me pursing my real estate license, which is lovely. It’s a super healthy work environment. But if I take this full-time position, what should I ask for salary-wise so that I’m not undervaluing myself or over extending myself? And how do I figure out where to put my energy without sacrificing my mental health?

careerguidance,Why did I get fired from an internship after two days?,"I secured an internship with a boutique production house that does BTS Photography, videography and title sequences. In the interview I had categorically stated that I am proficient in premiere pro and everything to do with videography and photography AND NOT DESIGN. I mentioned it several times that I do not know or enjoy design (he had seen my graphic illustrations and inquired about it) and had never used photoshop. He said that's completely okay and approved of the software I did use. He said we all do a little bit of everything though and u will be fine so I signed the contract which mentioned ASSISTANCE in design.
First day in they gave me client work in design with no on-boarding or briefing not even an introduction, it took me all day but I did it.
Second day I had to work on their system with their hard drives so I was just making sure I don't mess it up and asking a lot of questions, still I did the work. Another senior came and started showing me basic things on Excel and all and I knew them but I didn't contest it because she was just trying to help. I took a 20 min break that day after asking a senior what the policy was and she said yea go ahead.
Third day, a Sunday..same guy calls me and tells me I made a mistake in gauging your technical base and basic things like the system and photoshop not being in place just doesn't work for us, we should close the internship. What just happened to me???

careerguidance,Sus internship - should i take it?,"( western europe )

I recently interviewed with a startup for an internship in app and web development. During the interview, they explained the projects I’d be working on but didn’t ask many questions. They mostly just asked me to explain the projects I’ve worked on before.

They mentioned the internship is 100% remote, and they don’t currently have an office—though they said they might in the future. The company has six employees, half of whom are interns. They also have experience working with interns, so this seems to be part of their business model.

After the interview, I asked my university if a fully remote internship would be acceptable, and they said no, it needs to be in-office. So, I emailed the company to let them know that remote work wouldn’t be allowed.

23M-Graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice. I’m grateful in that I live in a HCOL at home with my parents therefore I am not under water yet, but I have made multiple attempts to spread my wings and they got to be clipped at this point. I cannot get a good criminal justice job for the life of me. I fail every single polygraph I take purely because of the job hunt anxiety I have. Found out this morning I am out of the hunt for another Homeland Security Job.  Got denied for a Bureau of Prisons secretary job. Got denied for two different local police agencies. One for polygraph, one for a stupid traffic ticket (illegal left turn), they never even cared to do answer my appeal. Two years of hunting and nothing. I have 8 years of consistent work experience moving up the chain at my private education job. It’s insane because I literally can do anything and everything that is asked of me in mere seconds yet I feel like an utter waste. I have done everything from changing the thermostats to lifeguarding to running the front office to running the athletics program. I have no criminal background (otherwise I wouldn’t be employed at a school lol). I don’t do any drugs. I have the work experience and a degree, yet I am finding myself shut out of my entire field of study. If it helps I’m in South Florida (not sure if that is doxxing myself).

datascience,The coding issues data teams encounter are truly intriguing,"Hi, over the past 9 months, we have been working on Upsonic and have obtained some outputs from the discussions we've had. I would like to share these with you as well. If there are any points you disagree with, please feel free to write them down, I would be very happy about that🙏🏻

We conducted more than 300 interviews with data teams. During these conversations, we noticed that across different projects, around 30-40% of the code in their notebooks is repetitive and reusable.

The development-related problems of data teams are not clearly understood, and the problems also vary by location. It's like they are in a fog, and it's very hard to find a solution. We discovered these 3 main reasons for this problem in data teams:

1- The product for data teams is the output they get from the data, not the code. But in development, code is the product. There are best practices in the coding world, so if you are writing code, you need to adhere to these best practices as much as possible, regardless of your purpose. However, these practices and tools are developed for developers. That's why data teams struggle with using these tools in their development processes. Moreover, these tools are not compatible enough, and not everyone in the team is equally proficient with them.

2- While doing data exploration in Jupyter, they can't directly push the code to Git to share it. There is a diff issue between Git and Python/Jupyter. That's why they struggle with collaborative work.

3- Data scientists have many reusable components and things they can share, but the individual work culture affects the collaborative work culture. The same things are repeatedly done for the company.



After discovering these problems and their reasons, we built a function hub to facilitate collaborative work. We provide 3 key features that data teams need:

1- We allow teams to share their functions with teammates with a single command from within their notebooks. Other team members can pull the same function with a single command. 

2- We document everything that is pushed to the function hub, including the functions, commits, and release notes, so teams can understand each other's code. 

3- We use AI to read Jupyter files, find the reusable components, and send them to the platform. This way, even if the code quality is low, it can be refactored into a function and made available for the team to use.

Since there is no one with extensive DS experience in our team, we conducted 300 interviews. We are still continuing our research. I would love to hear your feedback.

datascience,What sort of job titles and roles should I look for?,"Hi, I've been working as an analyst for a retail company for a few years, but it's pretty basic and mostly focused on reporting, dashboards, etc, so I'm looking for more roles with a heavier data science and computation focus. But I'm getting overwhelmed and confused about what sorts of roles to look for.

A quick google search for ""types of roles in data science"" and you'll find dozens of pages filled with SEO-driven buzzwords (possibly AI-generated), but these only give the most surface-level and generic descriptions of common titles like data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, etc. This isn't really what I'm looking for though lol. I know what these are. Also, so many roles today seem to just be focused on shoving the latest LLM stack (RAG, langchain, etc) into the problem even if the use case for the company is slim or marginal at best. This isn't really what I'm interested in cause I like operations data science more.

What I'm looking for is a more specific, tailored advice relevant to specific types of industries/specializations. For example

* I really like building models that heavily rely on functional programming, and may make use of very niche or specific libraries depending on the use case. I enjoy Project Euler type problems for example
* I understand ML is a core part of data science, but I enjoy projects where ML isn't exclusive to the problem. A lot of other models can be solved by more functional programming and tailored computational science type work
* I guess my background right now is mostly focused on business/operations/economics, so I don't have a specific engineering or hard science background, but I'm open to any area that invovles applied mathematics.

I would appreciate any and all advice. As specific or general as possible.

datascience,Announcing Plotlars 0.7.1: We’re Back with Deep Refactoring and Exciting New Features! 🦀✨📊,"Hello Data Scientists!

After a long hiatus, I’m thrilled to announce that **Plotlars 0.7.1** is now released!

I’ve resumed the project with a deep refactoring. I believe Rust can be a great candidate for data science, but we have a long journey ahead to achieve it. This crate aims to reduce the complexity when making plots, making data visualization in Rust more accessible and straightforward.

🚀 New Features

1. **Heat Maps**: We’ve added support for heat maps, enabling you to create color-coded representations of data matrices. Heat maps are perfect for visualizing data density, correlations, and patterns across two dimensions, making it easier to identify trends and anomalies in your datasets.
2. **Scatter 3D Plots**: Introducing 3D scatter plots to Plotlars! Now you can visualize your data in three dimensions, providing a new perspective on relationships and clusters within your data. Rotate and zoom into your plots for an immersive data exploration experience.

A huge thank you to all of you for your continued support, contributions, and feedback. Your enthusiasm drives this project forward.

Explore the [updated documentation](https://docs.rs/plotlars/0.7.1) and head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alceal/plotlars) to see the new features in action. If you enjoy using Plotlars, **consider leaving a star ⭐️ on GitHub to help others discover the project** and support its ongoing development.

  
**This project is a breakthrough that’s set to transform the field – share it to be part of the change!**

So - a year ago we set out to build an alternative: Jaws Deploy (pun intended… sharks eat octopus).

We have had a closed trial since August 2024. There are currently one fairly large and a few medium sized organizations using it to manage deployment of \~25 C#/C++ projects to around 120 machines (Linux &amp; Windows) on all continents.

We are now ready to bring on board more trial users. We will assist all trial users with setting up deployments in Jaws, and we will build the product based on feedback. Pricewise we intend to keep it simple; Jaws will cost 50% of Octopus. We also have a free plan!

We support:

* Use Internal or External Nuget repository for builds. Or use FTP, Blob, Gitlab, Azure, TC, Jenkins etc). Push &amp; Pull supported.
* Transforming config files &amp; injecting secrets (Azure Keyvault, AWS or any other source)
* Running custom scripts (Powershell 7)
* Pre-made deployment step templates
* Streamlined installation of agents on machines (Run a script or use Octopus to deploy Jaws 🦈)
* Dashboard for keeping track of Releases, Deployments, Machines, Environments etc.

Future roadmap:

* Import projects directly from Octopus (Q1 2025)
* Bash &amp; Python Support (Q1 2025)
* More deployment step templates (Q4 2024)
* Support for Docker/Kubernetes (2025)

I’m a recent CS grad with 6-7 months of hands-on experience as a DevOps intern.

devops,Hybrid cloud - azure arc agent and IMDSv2 from AWS,"Hey guys! 👋🏻 I don’t know if I should put this question here but got no answer so far on azure forum.

I’m talking about an hybrid cloud environment. On my work, we have aws ec2 instances running which have azure arc agent installed on them. For now we have been using IMDSv1 which allows for calls to instance metadata service with or without token. I’m changing that, so I have updated all our scripts to use tokens to get the info they need from IMDS.

Now, here is my question. What about azure arc agent? It seems we are having some requests without tokens coming from the arc agent. What I was told was that azure arc agent would adapt once I enforced IMDSv2 and would start making requests with tokens for the authentication.

I tried to look into Microsoft documentation to try and get information to support this claim. But since I’m new I’m still not sure if I’m looking into the correct place. 

Can you help me guide to the correct piece of information or explain me better this scenario?

Been working as backend dev. last 3 years but still playing with home lab etc. since I was in SRE/DevOps field before and my heart still belongs to ""old style sysadmin"". This isn't something that is aiming to replace nginx or something but since I fell in love with Go, I wanted to create something useful. The project is still in active development but I've been already using it for some small internal APIs at work and seems to be working great. I'm still working on documentation because not all features are documented right now but it should be enough to get you started.

**🔧 Project Highlights**:

* **Concurrency Handling:** Utilizes Go’s goroutines and channels to efficiently manage multiple connections.
* **Load Balancing Algorithms:** Implements Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hashing and some other, to distribute traffic effectively.
* **Support for TLS termination/offloading**
* **Health Monitoring:** Each service gets its own continuous health check to ensure traffic is only directed to healthy nodes.
* **Dynamic Configuration and status monitoring via API:** Ability to add or remove backend servers on-the-fly via admin API as well as monitoring status, health etc.
* **Metrics &amp; Logging - WIP:** Currently working on it. As for today, it logs to file and console asynchronous but I'm planning to implement prometheus integration.
* **Graceful Shutdown:** Ensures all active connections are properly handled during shutdowns or restarts.
* **Auto certificate manager -** if you define tls configuration globally or on each service, it will first try to use that but if not - it will try with lets encrypt.

Bugs are expected and I don't consider it as nginx/haproxy replacement. Just trying something new.

devops,A deep dive into the tar format,"Hey again 👋

You may have seen my recent posts on different container image compression formats such as [zstd](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1gb4e98/using_zstd_compression_with_buildkit_decompresses/) and [estargz](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1grfchd/lazy_pulling_docker_images_for_80_faster_startup/). I have spent a lot of time lately looking at the different compression utilities and algorithms we use on collections of files, but I noticed the one thing that never changes is the *tar*.

All docker layers are compressed tar archives, caches in CI are stored as tar archives, almost every collection of files is some form of tar.

Why is ""tar"" the de facto standard archival format? Where did it come from? Should we be using something better? Let's learn a little more about ""tar"" together.

This post is a preview of my [full blog post, available here.](https://depot.dev/blog/what-is-a-tar-file)

# Origin of tar

The \`tar\` utility was [created in 1979 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)#History)to replace the now-ancient \`[tp](https://www.unix.com/man-page/bsd/1/tp/)\` command. Still, like \`tp\`, tar was a format and utility specifically designed for magnetic tape, and magnetic tape drives. You'll notice a lot of the interesting quirks of \`tar\` can be explained in the context of being used on a tape drive, which is of course no longer a concern today.

Officially, \`tar\` was replaced in 2001 by the \`pax\` command. But it (tar) became so ubiquitous that it is still the standard go-to utility for file archiving today.

# Inspecting a tar file

Let's perform a small experiment to see what we can learn about a tar file. Let's start by creating a file we can archive.

`echo ""level 1, type grass"" &gt; bulbasaur.txt`

\`tar\` accepts a \`-c\` flag to indicate we want to create an archive, and we can use the \`-f\` flag to specify the output file. We can pass in any number of files or directories to archive.

`tar -cf pokeball.tar bulbasaur.txt`

That should leave us with a \`pokeball.tar\` file. This is not compressed, you may have seen \`.tar.gz\` before, but we rarely see uncompressed \`tar\` files, for good reason. We'll get back to that.

The data that makes up the tar is simple ASCII text, we can actually see the majority of the data fairly cleanly by using \`cat\` to display the data.

    cat pokeball.tar
    bulbasaur.txt0000644000000000000000000000002414716660325012303 0ustar  rootrootlevel 1, type grass

# Tar File Structure

[\[ image - tar file structure \]](https://depot.dev/images/tar-file-structure.webp)

***\[ (header \[512B\]) + (data \[512B \* x\]) + (End-Of-Archive \[512B \* 2\]) \]***

Each file in a tar archive is converted into a ""tar file"". A tarfile is simply a header, of a specific size, followed the data in the file.

The header contains information like the name of the file, the creation time, owner id, and a few other metadata fields. Immediately after the header is the raw contents of the file.

The header, and the contents are all stored in blocks of 512 bytes. If the data doesn't require 512B, it will be padded with null bytes to fill the space. Similarly if the data is over 512B, it will be split into blocks of 512, with the last of which being padded to ensure there is a whole number of blocks.

After all tar files in the archive are inserted, sequentially, an additional two empty 512B blocks are added as an end-of-archive marker. \`tar\` will be looking for these two empty blocks as a sign to end the unarchiving process.

# The Tar File Header

Trying to inspect a tar file from the output of \`cat\` can be a bit challenging. Instead, since we know a tar file is just a header + the original data, let's take a closer look at the [structure of the tar header](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.html).

|Field|Size (bytes)|Byte Offset|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|`name`|100|0|File name|
|`mode`|8|100|File permissions|
|`uid`|8|108|User ID|
|`gid`|8|116|Group ID|
|`size`|12|124|File size in bytes|
|`mtime`|12|136|Modification time (UNIX timestamp)|
|`chksum`|8|148|Header checksum|
|`typeflag`|1|156|File type (e.g., regular file, directory)|
|`linkname`|100|157|Name of linked file (if symbolic link)|
|`magic`|6|257|Format identifier (e.g., `ustar`)|
|`version`|2|263|Format version (`00`)|
|`uname`|32|265|User name|
|`gname`|32|297|Group name|
|`devmajor`|8|329|Major device number (if special file)|
|`devminor`|8|337|Minor device number (if special file)|
|`prefix`|155|345|Prefix for file name (for long file names)|
|**Padding**|12|500|Padding to make the header 512 bytes|

Armed with this, we can now use a tool like \`hexdump\` to get a more clear view of the data.

Let's say we wanted to know the file size of \`bublasaur.txt\`, we can use this table to know we should read 12 bytes starting at the 124th byte in the file.

    hexdump -s 124 -n 12 -C pokeball.tar
    
    0000007c  30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30  30 32 34 00              |00000000024.|

The 24 value here is actually still in octal form since we are looking at raw bytes, so a quick conversion back to decimal will help us see the true value.

    &gt; echo $((8#24))
    20

That shows us the original file was 20B!

# Why is our tar file so large?

From what we know about the structure of the tar archive so far, we should have a single header block, which is 512 bytes, one data block, and two end-of-archive markers.

*512B (header) + 512B (contents) + 512B (empty) + 512B (empty) = 2048B*

Somehow our 20B file got away from us and became 2 kilobytes. Let's double check to be sure.

    stat pokeball.tar
    
    File: pokeball.tar
      Size: 10240

Woah! 10KB? How the heck did that happen?

# Blocking factor

Another interesting feature of tar that stems from its magnetic tape origins. Magnetic tape takes time to spin up to speed and slow down. It was more efficient to store data in longer chunks at a time due to the mechnical and linear  design of magnetic tape. Today this is less relevant, but still tar implements what is called a ""blocking factor"".

Tape drives read data not in increments of blocks, but instead by ""record"". A record in tar by default is 20 blocks. That means there are 19 additional empty data blocks in our tar archive, filled with padding.

If you happen to be working with small files or a small amount of data, you can ajust your blocking factor.

    tar --blocking-factor=1 -cf pokeball_single_record.tar bulbasaur.txt
    
    stat pokeball_single_record.tar
    
    File: pokeball_single_record.tar
      Size: 2048

With the blocking factor set to 1, we get our original calculation. Still quite a bit larger than the original file, almost exclusively due to null bytes in padding again.

# Compressing a tar file

[\[ pokeball .tar.gz image \]](https://depot.dev/images/pokeball_targz.webp)

I got into this in more detail in [the full blog post](https://depot.dev/blog/what-is-a-tar-file) but tldr, this is why you often see not `.tar` files, but `.tar.gz`. All of that empty space in a tar archive isn't ideal but it is hardly anything to worry about once compression is applied.

**Gzip**

gzip is the long standing standard compression method and it works well enough and fast enough to offset the inefficiencies of the tar format. It is also worth mentioning the overhead of a tar archive shrinks proportionally with the size of the archive. Fewer large files will store more efficiently.

You can use multiple compression tools directly within the `tar` command. Use the `-z` flag with `-c` to create a `gzip` archive.

    tar -czf pokedex.tar.gz bulbasaur.txt squirtle.txt charmander.txt

**Zstandard**

Gzip, like tar, will likely be around for many more decades to come, but it would be difficult to ignore how quickly Facebook's `zstd` compression is gaining traction.

The `gzip` utility is antiquated, and still a single-threaded application. Though a multi-threaded implementation of `gzip` named `pigz` exists. Zstandard by comparison, being much newer, is multi-threaded by default.

We ran some of [our own tests](https://depot.dev/blog/building-images-gzip-vs-zstd#comparison-of-decompression-times) that agree with the claims made by `zstd`, that decompression speeds are about 60% faster compared to `gzip`.

You can use either the `--zstd` flag, or simply the `-a` flag, which will auto detect the crompression tool from the output file extension.

    tar -czf pokedex.tar.gz bulbasaur.txt squirtle.txt charmander.txt

You will need to ensure that `zstd` is installed on the system first.

gaming,"An argument for playing Alien: Isolation if you're interested, but scared
","Please disagree if you've played and think, ""Yeah, no. This is 10,000% full of shit. Nice try, Xenomorph.""  
  
**But at least on NORMAL difficulty, I really think this game is on your side and wants you to beat it.** Some games make you have fun via good storytelling and great dialogue. Other games make you have fun by throwing lots of action and enemies at you and putting you in a flow state. I think this game makes you have fun by TERRIFYING you, but not in a frustrating, or time-wasting way.  
  
I realized this (or convinced myself of this) like 45% of the way through my recent first playthrough. And once I realized it, I moved swiftly through the remaining 55% and I sincerely, absolutely loved it. I didn't rush the second half or anything, but the first 45% took me a very long time, and I would spend each play-session kind of procrastinating booting the game up. I felt so much dread and anxiety just looking at the main menu with the GIANT face of Jupiter staring at you lol.

You constantly see Jupiter throughout the game, always reminding you of how small or helpless you are.

But I think a big part of my dread actually came from the save system. You can't save whenever you want. You have to do it at certain checkpoints. And that whole concept just made me very tense, and I loathed the idea of losing good progress.  
  
But this idea that ***""the game is on your side""*** occurred to me when I came across a checkpoint, then struggled through a 15-minute tense chunk of the map, and then came to another save point. I thought, ""Huh. That was like a quick, self-contained section."" And then I realized that the whole game is sort of structured that way. You have 19 main missions, but I think each mission can be broken apart into lots of tiny sections. Each save point is like the beginning of a mini-chapter.  
  
When you die, it can feel devastating. But then you realize that you never really lose that much progress. They are very generous with the save points.  
  
And so I think the game makes a double-edged agreement with you. It agrees to let you save a lot, but in return you have to be ok with getting REALLY fucking scared lmao.  
  
If the game was bullshitty, I think the save points would be like 30-minutes apart. And then if the alien grabbed you from above, it would feel super frustrating and stupid and more annoying than scary.  
  
But the way it works in actuality, if you die, it only takes like a minute or two to get back to where you were. You move much faster the second (or third, or sixth...) time around because like half the battle is being lost and not knowing the map. So the game can kill you in all sorts of horrifying ways--""THE XENOMORPH CAN DO THAT!?!??!""--but because it doesn't waste your time, you're having FUN being scared, and aren't loathing having to replay large sections.  
  
This makes it even more effective because you lean in and cooperate with the experience of being scared. You aren't pulled away from the experience because you're dreading having to replay long sections.  
  
I really don't think this game wants you to give up. It is also strangely therapeutic to face all of this anxiety and fear head-on, and slooowly make relentless forward progress through it all. You can hide in a locker as long as you want, but eventually, you have to get out and press forward.  
  
I think anyone with a normal tolerance for fear can have a great time with Alien: Isolation. (But for people who actually suffer from high anxiety, it might be too much. The game is legitimately scary.) BUT IT'S ON YOUR SIDE! (But your neck will hurt because your shoulders will constantly be up by your ears.) BUT IT WANTS YOU TO BEAT IT!

Use all of your senses. Imagine as closely as possible actually doing the task and feeling motivated and energized while doing it.

If at any point you lose the feeling, go back to Step 1 and re-establish it. Then go back to step 2.

Do as long as needed.

This is basically a modified loving-kindness meditation, where you replace loving-kindness with motivation. It's a specific instance of what I call ""emotion practice"" since you can apply it to any emotion you want.

𝐄𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞:

I wake up and I’m feeling unmotivated to finish up a post I’ve been writing.

I sit down, back straight (important to have an energetic posture while doing this. You cannot do it lying down).

I visualize my early EA career when I was incredibly motivated. I remember happily working long hours, just so excited to make a difference. I pay attention to the welling up feeling of energy in my chest, then my hands. My leg starts bouncing. I pay attention and lean into the feeling.

Then I think of editing the piece. I visualize myself at the keyboard, looking at the Google Doc, jamming away to my favorite music, loving the feeling of checking it off my list. My leg is bouncing in my visualization and reality.

I feel a bit of an ugh field around the formatting and lose the feeling. I go back to remembering my early career. I remember one particular day when I was doing a jogging meeting with a fellow volunteer and felt like I had endless energy.

I go back to thinking about formatting, and the feeling of motivation overwhelms the ugh field, and it feels like the ugh field dissolves.

I keep imagining editing for another 2 minutes, but then I feel too motivated to actually do the editing that I stop meditating and get started. This is by far the most common way I finish motivation meditations.

𝐓𝐢𝐩: if you find it hard to stay focused, do it as a writing meditation. Just write a stream of consciousness, do not edit or spellcheck.

GetMotivated,"You shouldn't have a meditation practice. That artificially constrains you to meditating when there are so many paths to happiness. Instead, you should have a “happiness workout routine”, a regular time of day where you do things to improve your mental health, such as CBT, journaling, ACT, etc[text]","𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧’𝐬 𝐞𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐦𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐛𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭’𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐲  
  
Most happiness techniques are like diets. Most diets work. . . 𝘪𝘧 you follow them.   
  
The problem is that most people don’t follow through with most techniques for a myriad of reasons. Some because they’re too painful to keep up, some because by design, they’re only for a short period of time.  
  
Likewise, it’s a stereotype that people will go to a self-development seminar or meditation retreat and be all pumped up for a week or two. Then they’ll fall straight back into their old patterns. Likewise, there’s disconcerting evidence that practically every type of therapy has the same effect size.  
  
Some think this is because the methods don’t work and it’s all hype. This could very well be true. An alternative hypothesis that I think is more likely is that there are a lot of ways to be happier, but they only work 𝘪𝘧 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘬𝘦𝘦𝘱 𝘥𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘮.

Likewise, you can’t just go on a meditation retreat then be happy for the rest of your life while you continuously get caught up in neurotic stories your mind is telling you about the past and future.   
  
This is why having a meditation practice is such genius. Part of the whole memeplex of meditation is that it’s something you do 𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘭𝘺. Meditation retreats are the occasional big races interspersed between your regular running habit. This routinization of the technique makes it so much more effective than other interventions, such as CBT, which are often done only while you have a therapist pushing you to, but fades into the background once you stop going.  
  
The only problem I have with a meditation practice is that it artificially constrains you to just meditation when there are so many other extremely useful techniques to improve your happiness.   
  
This is why years ago I stopped calling my practice a meditation practice and started calling it my happiness workout routine. It’s made my happiness journey so much better that I had to share it with others, hence this post.

hacking,How to start hacking? The ultimate two path guide to information security.,"Before I begin - everything about this should be totally and completely ethical at it's core. I'm not saying this as any sort of legal coverage, or to not get somehow sued if any of you screw up, this is genuinely how it should be. The idea here is **information security.** I'll say it again. **information security.** The whole point is to make the world a better place. **This isn't for your reckless amusement and shot at recognition with your friends.** **This is for the betterment of human civilisation. Use your knowledge to solve real-world issues.**

&amp;#x200B;

There's no singular all-determining path to 'hacking', as it comes from knowledge from all areas that eventually coalesce into a general intuition. Although this is true, there are still two common rapid learning paths to 'hacking'. I'll try not to use too many technical terms.

&amp;#x200B;

The first is the simple, effortless and result-instant path. This involves watching youtube videos with green and black thumbnails with an occasional anonymous mask on top teaching you how to download well-known tools used by thousands daily - or in other words the 'Kali Linux Copy Pasterino Skidder'. You might do something slightly amusing and gain bit of recognition and self-esteem from your friends. Your hacks will be 'real', but anybody that knows anything would dislike you as they all know all you ever did was use a few premade tools. The communities for this sort of shallow result-oriented field include [r/HowToHack](https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToHack) ~~and probably r/hacking as of now~~.
&amp;#x200B;


The second option, however, is much more intensive, rewarding, and mentally demanding. It is also much more fun, if you find the right people to do it with. It involves learning everything from memory interaction with machine code to high level networking - all while you're trying to break into something. This is where Capture the Flag, or 'CTF' hacking comes into play, where you compete with other individuals/teams with the goal of exploiting a service for a string of text (the flag), which is then submitted for a set amount of points. It is essentially competitive hacking. Through CTF you learn literally everything there is about the digital world, in a rather intense but exciting way. Almost all the creators/finders of major exploits have dabbled in CTF in some way/form, and almost all of them have helped solve real-world issues. However, it does take a lot of work though, as CTF becomes much more difficult as you progress through harder challenges. Some require mathematics to break encryption, and others require you to think like no one has before. If you are able to do well in a CTF competition, there is no doubt that you should be able to find exploits and create tools for yourself with relative ease. The CTF community is filled with smart people who can't give two shits about elitist mask wearing twitter hackers, instead they are genuine nerds that love screwing with machines. There's too much to explain, so I will post a few links below where you can begin your journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember - this stuff is not easy if you don't know much, so google everything, question everything, and sooner or later you'll be down the rabbit hole far enough to be enjoying yourself. CTF is real life and online, you will meet people, make new friends, and potentially find your future.

I am looking for good learning resources for Golang in Hindi that are suitable for someone with no prior programming experience.



I want to start from the very basics — learning programming concepts, syntax, and understanding how to solve problems with code — all in the context of Go.



If you know of any YouTube channels, online courses, or websites (preferably free or affordable) that explain programming fundamentals and Golang in simple Hindi, please share them!



Thank you in advance! 🙏

learnprogramming,My Struggle as a Self-Taught Developer,"I've always wanted to be a programmer—well, not really. Back then, I didn’t even know what ""programmer"" meant. I just wanted to create things, like the technology I saw on TV. I thought it would be impossible, something only geniuses or scientists could do. Fast forward, here I am, chasing that dream!

It all started when I was 13. The first time I accessed the internet on a laptop, I began searching for what I could do with this magical thing called “Google” That’s when I stumbled upon a fascinating concept: programming. I didn’t understand much, but it sounded exciting.

During summer holidays, I began searching how computers work. It amazed me how simple technology could be—especially for achieving my childhood dream. As a kid, I was glued to documentaries about robots in Silicon Valley and China. While most kids my age were watching cartoons or Barbie, I was fascinated by machines (I loved Barbie too! I'm not a nerd, okay?🙂)

In the summer of 2019, I discovered HTML5 through a YouTube channel and created my very first webpage. It was just a basic “this is my first page” header, but it felt like magic. I was so proud and told everyone about it, but no one really got it—all they saw was a browser tab with some text.

Still, I pressed on. I experimented with CSS, building colorful layouts, navbars, footers, and grids. Then I dove into JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and MySQL. I was learning, exploring, and dreaming big.

Then came the pandemic. In my final year of high school, COVID turned everything upside down. After graduating in 2020, I went to nursing school—not because I wanted to, but because studying computer science wasn’t an option in my city. Plus, the CS curriculum in my country was so outdated, I knew I’d have to teach myself anyway.

Working as a nurse during COVID was overwhelming. My plan was to learn programming in the evenings after work, but after 8-to-6 shifts in pure chaos, I barely had any energy left. Still, I pushed through. I completed my residency program, got licensed, and finally quit nursing to focus on programming.

Now, I’ve been teaching myself for a while. I’ve built projects, learned different tools, and tried to improve step by step. But the journey hasn’t been easy.

Being self-taught often feels lonely. You doubt yourself. You feel like you’re constantly catching up. And with the job market so competitive, it’s easy to lose hope. I planned to land a job or internship as a developer by the end of the year, but that hasn’t happened yet—I haven’t even applied. And the pressure is mounting—I’m turning 22 this week, and I need a job.

But I’m not giving up. Software development is what I want, and I haven’t given it my all yet. This is just the beginning of my journey, not the end.

Technology has always been my passion, and I want to be part of shaping the future. Whether it’s building tools that help people, solving unique problems, I know my story is far from over.

If you’ve been through this or are going through something similar, I’d love to hear your story or any advice you might have.",Human-Reporter-3657,https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzwey1/my_struggle_as_a_selftaught_developer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gzwey1/my_struggle_as_a_selftaught_developer/,2024-11-25 22:48:15,20,0.92,20,0,4,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,
learnprogramming,Problems with managing the list of files in a modal with manual loading and Drag and Drop,"I have a modal to which I can upload files manually using a button or using Drag and Drop.



The  first bug occurs when dealing with the list of documents, when adding one or more documents that are not previously there, the `start` button appears that starts the upload of the file and `delete` which removes the file from the list and the Upload all and Delete all buttons also appear. The errors are that when deleting 2 documents from the list, whether it is duplicate or not, the **upload all** and **delete all** buttons disappear and the original documents have a progress bar that should only appear when the document is uploaded. I attach image links:

[before deleting](https://i.sstatic.net/pIC8tmfg.png) | [after deleting two documents](https://i.sstatic.net/f2AnpE6t.png)

The second bug is more complicated, to simplify the explanation I will call the ""*instrucciones sectigo*"" document **A** and the ""*idea cleaner parones*"" document I will call **B**. The use case is the following, I upload **A** and **B**, I upload **A** again and **B** and marks them as duplicates, disabling the 'start' button, I delete the duplicate of A and upload A and B again. If I now click the ""**Delete all**"" button, They delete all the documents from the list except the original **A** *(I know that rarely a user is going to cause this bug since, as I said, it is very complicated, but I find it very curious why this happens).*

learnprogramming,"Looking for best DS+Algos Course to prep for Summer Internship 2025, Beginner Friendly","Hi! I'm seeking advice on preparing for summer internship 2025 coding interviews (SWE, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or anything coding-related). I've started to leetcode and know that data structures and algorithms are key for interviews. I’m looking for an online course to take over winter break—something not too heavy but effective since I’ve already taken an intro to DS and algos course.

**My background:**

* **Experience:** 2+ years in market research with a focus on data analysis (non coding)
* **Education:** Undergrad in econ, currently finishing my first semester of my CS master’s program. I also did a data science bootcamp focusing on python a few years ago.
* **Courses so far:** Intro to DS and algorithms, Intro to Java. Next semester I'll be taking the DS + Algos course beyond intro level.
* **On the side:** brushing up on Python as I heard it's easier for coding interviews
* **Goals:** Not aiming for prestigious internships lol—just want to build solid skills to compete for internships as I have far less coding experience than undergrad CS juniors.

Can anyone recommend a good winter break course or strategy to strengthen my coding skills, **especially in data structures and algos prep aimed for coding interviews**?

learnprogramming,Building a website with database search,"Hey all,

For learning purposes, I want to build a website/web app that does the following:

1. The first/home page let's the user input a UK car reg and submit it. If the car reg is valid, it will display info about the car (basic stuff for now) but will also store the car reg and info into a database table (say cars). If the same car is searched again, it will pull the info from the table.

2. On a different page, let the user search through the cars table. They can search by car reg, make, model etc.

I want a modern looking UI and to be relatively snappy.

I can write a python script to pull the car info but that's about it.

I'm looking to avoid no-code as I want to learn the tools myself. I have no particular time limit on this.

Edit: lol forgot to ask questions. I don't really know how to go about this and want some direction. I feel like my idea is straightforward and done 1000s of times and there is some decent guide I can follow.

learnpython,Paramiko / Secure CRT,"Hello everybody,

First of all, I'm a beginner user in python. I'm struggling with python and myself to learn it by creating scripts for networking.

Well, I can run my scripts using python v3.13, but when I finally create a script to run it on secure crt app to reach routers through ssh... I have an issue with paramiko library: secure crt doesn't recognize it.

This library is installed correctly in my laptop and I can even run this script on Windows using a terminal or visual code... But secure crt isn't able to run it.

I've been searching for information on the Internet and the instructions are clear: pip install paramiko and that's it. The path seems correct. I was wondering if the version is the issue. No clue.

I can run bash scripts and ""preinstalled"" python scripts, but ofc, no third libraries are written on them, they are rather simple scripts.

Could anyone help me please??

`Error: spawn c:\Users\Me\OneDrive\Desktop\VSCode\python\.venv\Scripts\python.exe\Scripts\manim ENOENT[undefined] Execution returned code=-4058 in 0.002 seconds`

Please help. What I have done is I went to preferences\\settings in VSCode, and went to default manim path or whatever its called, and deleted whatever was inside because I would not for the life of me find my manim.exe file.

If anyone knows what the hell a manim.exe file, please let me know.

I can't find any solution apart from cryptic clues about changing this setting. So yeah.

Another error I encounter does not actually run an error, but when running my code using manim sidebar (no errors in the code by the way) it pops up with ""Name of your Scene"", and there are no more options other than ""I'll provide it myself"". For everyone else it seems that there are visible options, for example:

`class Circle(Scene):`

would result in the option &lt;&lt; Circle

But there is no such option. Just ""provide myself"". When I do so I run an error.

ONE MORE WEIRD THING:

I now have a file displayed on my VSCode sidebar called\_pycache\_, which contains a file called manimtest.cpython But when I compile and read it it has a bunch of ""null"" symbols in red. Specifically:

learnpython,"Is it bad practice (in intro to Python class) after 4 hours of debugging, to erase parts of your code you don't think you need? That you merely added while trying to figure out the bug? [quicksort algorithm related] 😖","I just got finished banging my head against a proverbial wall for well over 3 hours. My professor gave as assignment which was 20x harder than any previous assignment of the first 8 weeks. Needless to say, it's not due until Monday but I'm so over it and want nothing more to do with this source code due to egregious stress &amp; frustration. 

Should I now mentally ""backtrack"" and start deleting parts of my code which likely didn't contribute any meaningful functionality to my source code? The bug was due to me iterating over a full list, when I was supposed to be iterating ""current_wordcount"" times, so I was iterating over len(my_list) rather than iterating over current_wordcount. Here are the relevant lines of code that are now correct:

    def timed_quicksort(sort_type):
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Sorting the list based on sort type
        if sort_type == ""COUNT"":
            quicksort(ListOfCounts, 0, current_word_count - 1, ListOfWords)
        elif sort_type == ""WORD"":
            quicksort(ListOfWords, 0, current_word_count - 1, ListOfCounts)
        
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f""Quick Sort Time={end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds"")


To be honest, I underestimated this assignment and I would have benefited GREATLY by watching 3-4 videos on youtube explaining quicksort. I watched [one video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KBwdDEwal8) twice but still only understand the basic concept, but none of the details. 

In total, I probably made 5 unnecessary additions to my source code, trying to fix the bug. Is it good practice to delete 1 at a time, then re-test my code to make sure I didn't break anything? Or should I interpret today's experience as a ""learning moment"" to ***NEVER*** dive into a programming assignment without a flawless understanding of the concepts I'm trying to utilize &amp; implement? 

I definitely had way too much overconfidence today and just want advice on how to become a better programmer, in the context of taking some programming courses at a local community college.

LifeProTips,LPT: travelling with a pump bottle? Swap out the pump nozzle for a bottle cap. ,"Most bottles share a universal standard opening size and tread, meaning they can be swapped out. When travelling with a pump bottle of for example hair conditioner, I empty out the pump back into the bottle, disassemble the pump nozzle (ie take out the straw), and use a water bottle cap to securely close the bottle.

pcgaming,Thoughts on a completely new Game of Thrones game? ,"So I’m a massive fan of game of thrones series but overall dragons are so cool to me. Now there are many dragon games like Day of Dragons, ARK and so on. But I think we need a massive open world game where we have a detailed campaign as long as a coop/multiplayer.  Ability to find dragon eggs around the map and then waiting for them to hatch and train the dragon and so on. Have the ability to ride the dragon and just fly around in a detailed and nice open world 🌍.  Now ik there is a game of thrones game but tbh I hate it and it’s not good.  Need a modern graphic game made 🔥🔥

pcgaming,Stop Destroying Games plans to eliminate digital planned obsolescence and bolster consumer rights,"There's a European Citizens' Initiative going around to stop publishers from intentionally bricking video games they have already sold to customers, a practice that may well violate EU consumer law. If passed by gaining 1 million EU signatures before July 31, it would address the legally untested practice of whether publishers can design games and digital content so that they can expire after an arbitrary length of time. This would also act as a bolster for digital consumer rights and ownership and stop online-only dependency spreading to other industries (extra citations)

personalfinance,Leaked (SSN) social security number ,"I got an alert that my SSN was leaked on the dark web. My dad’s name is associated with it along with a fake address 🤦‍♀️ My dad and I’s relationship is strained. I went no contact for about 10 years for many reasons. Ironically in September of this year this alert was sent to me, but I didn’t see it. The following month in October I reached out to him (feeling guilty because he’s getting older and I didn’t want to live with any regrets). Now a month after contacting him (Nov) I just seen that he tried doing something with my SSN. I’m not sure if he did this when I was a kid and it’s just now showing up or if he tried doing it this year. What are my options?! I’m getting ready to buy a house in the next year or so.

personalfinance,"I'm 29, Got US$ 17,000 in VOO and US$ 14,000 in cash. I live in Dubai and need your advise to take a life decision:","Equity in VOO: US$ 17,000
Cash in hand: US$ 14,000
Monthly rent: US$ 800 
Other monthly expenses: US$ 300

I invest in VOO for my retirement. I work as a marketing manager here in Dubai and i hate my job. 

I was working as a realtor, but wasn't doing well because i had a lot of financial stress in my mind back in those days. Realtors don't get a salary here in Dubai. We have to work on commissions only. But i loved being a realtor, I'm an extrovert and love talking to people. I did close a few small deals and i loved the process. But i couldn't keep going because some months did zero business. Hence i took up this marketing job because i do have the knowledge and a little bit of technical expertise in digital marketing. 

I want to quit my job! 

The cash that i have will allow me to sustain for 1 year. For the next 12 months, ill be able to rent this apartment, eat and drink the way i am currently. But after i quit my job, i want to get back to being a real estate agent. The problem is: i would need to buy a used car which would cost me approximately USD 10,000 including insurance and transfering the ownership in my name 

Previously, while doing real estate, i borrowed Dad's car, but i can't do that anymore because he needs the car for his work. I stay with my parents btw and do not want to ask them for money or help because i know they're financially burdend too. 

I need advise: 
Do i cash out my VOO? 
Do i work this shitty current job for a few more months? 
Anything else that i can do? 

I might get freelance projects this upcoming week. These projects are to handle social media accounts, another thing that i'm actually not good at lol. I'm not sure how much will i get paid for the freelance gigs btw. The commercials haven't been finalized yet.

personalfinance,Need some car advice so that things aren't awkward at Thanksgiving...,"I wrecked my car &amp; need to buy a new one sooner than later. I work in the Film and Television Industry and while employment has been spotty in the last couple of years and while I expect for conditions to improve in the new year, my credit score took a really hard dip when I maxed out a couple of credit cards which I am slowly trying to climb my way out of. With one of them I was able to settle the remaining balance the other I am currently making payments down on it (4k remaining)
..but my score is currently in the 650s.  I'm assuming due to the recent charge offs that I was denied a auto loan from both my conventional bank and my credit union

 I am just wrapping up a TV show and have a little bit of savings. As of right now I have about $5000 saved. I feel like I need a car that is reliable and won't completely screw me over if something were to occur with that mechanically. I spotted a 2021 Dodge Durango with about 40K miles on it for about $31,000…. Fell in love with it after test driving it. And was able to get dealership financing @ $5k down, $596 for 72 mos @12.42% with a max care warranty included in the price.  

Now I know this APR is high but at the same time the best Bank of America can do right now is 5.99% with perfect credit And ultimately the plan is to refinance this car once I get into a better financial situation similarly to what I did with my last vehicle which was about $20k in 2020 and payed it off in about two years

All this being said I ran these numbers by my mom and she thinks this is a terrible idea and that I'm better off buying a car cash right now and holding onto it! Unfortunately the vehicles that are available at my current savings means that I would most likely have a car that's in the shop a lot or a lemon at worst... 

am I thinking clearly here or is she? Or are we both wrong? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

personalfinance,Completely new to investing and have no idea what I'm doing lol,"I posted this as a comment in another post but figured I create my own post to get as much advice as possible:

So I am completely new to managing my own accounts. I'm 26 and really only just starting out contributing to any retirement accounts. Before, I would just set up automatic deductions and let my 401k do it's thing. However, I recently opened a rollover ira and roth ira through Fidelity with about $1100 total across both accounts. 

I did some research and saw most people recommend putting money into the S&amp;P 500. (Again, completely new to investing so this might be a very ridiculous question, but) when I search up the S&amp;P 500 in fidelity it gives me the options of VOO, VOOG, .SPX, and SPY - how would I differentiate between different kinds of S&amp;P 500 options and know which to go with? 

For starting out, Fidelity also gives you the options to invest using ""target date funds"", ""index funds"", ""asset allocation funds"", and Fidelity Go. From what I've read so far, Fidelity Go is definitely a no go and index funds are recommended for those starting out. How would one choose between these options and choose which to start out with?

Sorry again for what I assume are silly questions!

personalfinance,Equifax won’t unfreeze my credit,"Hey everyone, not even totally sure this is the right subreddit to post on but I froze my credit with the 3 credit bureaus and while transunion and experian made it super easy to freeze and unfreeze, Equifax is holding my credit hostage lol. 

I’ve called twice before, answered a bunch of questions that don’t apply to me (which they’ve determined I’ve gotten wrong)  and once I’m finally able to talk to a representative they tell me i have to send my drivers license and social security over there because they don’t know if it’s me. Personally I don’t see how sending my personal info by mail proves that it’s me because it could just be someone who stole my wallet or something! Like unless I’m there to personally hand them my documents, how does that prove that it’s actually me doing it?

And what’s more, they tell me I can unfreeze my credit online through their website… which doesn’t even work. Once you sign in the only it does is give you their phone number to call. Can’t click on a home page or nothing! Only the “please give us a call” page. 

Is anyone else dealing with this? How have you dealt with it? And does their website work for you?

personalfinance,Example explaining paying off highest APR first,"Hey, so it's been a while since I've been in college, I've had a back surgery and some meds and some long COVID from a really bad bought of the good old 'vid. 

Wife and I got a house. 216k left about 4.5% APR. We got solar panels with 1.99%APR. I KNOW (unless I'm wrong in which case, legitly please educate me) when we go to sell the house in 10 yrs it will more or less sell as a unit and so whether we pay off the panels and sell the house with no profit or pay the house of more it doesn't really matter. 

So I'm in this argument with my wife. I know all financial basics, you pay the higher APR, like if we're going to dump extra money, it's into the house because it has the higher APR and over 10 yrs dollar for dollar that dollar paid generates high interest so it's almost like that money is worth more or the other account worth less paying it there. 

How would I go about meeting up an excel spreadsheet to show my wife what say an $200 payment a month over 10 yrs would make over 2 differt interest rates?

I know I've done stuff like this in school but God my brain is just grinding right now lol.

personalfinance,Question about Pension Plan v Credit Card Debt,"I (33) have been working a state job that has paid into a pension plan made me believe waiting until I was vested was worth the low wages I was being paid. There's close to $24,000 in this account that's estimated to provide me with a lifetime payment of \~$586/month upon my retirement at 65 (lmao). 

Between living in a HCOL with minimal COLA adjustments, student loans, and inflation, I've managed to rack up \~$16,000 in CC debt. I've been working on paying it down and believe I can continue doing so until June of 2025 when I need to leave my job to attend law school, but I will still be in about $12,000 of debt. 

I've been accepted at a couple of institutions with scholarship money, and invested too much time and money into the process this year that I'm unwilling to wait and reapply next year. Given that I expect my salary potential will increase five fold compared to what I'm earning now, and I'll still have approx 29 years of earning a salary post-grad, I am contemplating liquidating the pension, suffering the tax penalty, and paying off all of the high interest cards. 

Based on the crude math, I'm thinking that this is my most prudent decision while still being able to attend school next Fall. Is there something that I'm not thinking about?

photography,Why Do People Pair Expensive Lenses with Average Cameras?,"I’ve recently upgraded from a Canon M50 II (APS-C) to a Sony A7 IV (full frame) with a Sony 24-70mm f2.8 GM II lens and the 70-200 f2.8 GM I. My decision was influenced by the fact that I wanted a full-frame setup, and I didn’t feel it made sense to invest in expensive lenses that wouldn’t fully utilise their potential on my older APS-C camera. Also I just wanted to jump to the very top. The Sony G master lenses are 👌🏾

I’m curious what are the main reasons some photographers opt to use high-end lenses on entry- to mid-level camera bodies? Is it purely about budget constraints, or are there specific use cases where this combination makes sense? For example, are the advantages of quality lenses still noticeable despite the limitations of the camera body?

photography,Need advice on cleaning old analogue photos.,"Hi, I hope I'm in the right place to ask this question.  
I've inherited a large amount of photos and negatives from a family member and I plan on scanning them both to preserve them but also so everyone in the family can have a digital copy of them before splitting up the originals. Knowing my family once they are gone they are not coming back so I can't rescan them at a later date. I can't keep them either since my small little apartment does not have enough space for four moving boxes worth of photos, it's already too full as is! ( ꩜ ᯅ ꩜;)⁭ ⁭  
I've started scanning but put it on pause again once I noticed a number of photos are dirty, outside of dust that I can gently brush off with a fine soft brush.  
There are a some photos that seem to have (liquid) stains that look to be on top of the photo itself, some look like mineral deposits from water while others look oily, they have that rainbow like sheen, maybe from finger prints?  
.  
My question is how can I gently clean them so I don't damage the photos?  
.  
I've tried searching online but it's pretty hard, at least for me, to find trustworthy information. So far I've seen people recommending and saying to never use mineral oil, water, and isopropyl alcohol.  
The bulk of the photos seem to be from the 1960/70ies to the 2000s, however there are also a number of much older paper pictures of (great) grandparents from as far back as maybe 1900?  
In case it matters a quick look on the back of some of the newer ones are labeled with ""Kodak paper"" and ""Afga Prestige paper"". If more information is needed I can try to see if I can find any but most of the boxes are not easily accessible (small little apartment remember).  
.  
I assume that those really old photos are very sensitive so I'm not going to try to clean those and my idea was to start with the newer ones since those are probably not as fragile.  
.  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡

2025 comes with some new and exciting changes! To accompany the text and image-based (and occasional video) lessons, there will now be interactive mini-courses and activities designed to illustrate each lesson in more engaging ways. 

What does that mean? Well, I'll share an example: [here you will find an example mini course](https://www.thefocalpointhub.com/photo-class-2025) meant to be a supplement to the [compositional guidelines](https://www.thefocalpointhub.com/class-2024/13-composition) lesson.
Try it out! 

In addition to all of this, the Learning Journal will be making a comeback with a new version available for (free) download or paperback - keep an eye out for that in the coming weeks.

As always, we welcome everyone to join in the photo class, 52 Weeks prompt challenge, or even just as a member of the [discord server](https://discord.gg/focal-point-with-c-london-785447750447267860) - and we look forward to seeing what you create!

photography,Creative photos of clothing.,"Hello!

(Idk if the tags are right, but this isn't some large business at all)

My mom designs and knits clothing, and sells it around our country. 
We're struggling to take good pictures of the clothing and getting the color through.

We really want to take some creative pictures, which stands out, but they always turn out a little dodgy. It doesn't represents her talent very well. 

Can anybody help with some ideas, that spice the pictures a bit up and makes it look fun?😅

Thank you so much!

Physics,Magnetic Field Evolution of Jupiter and Neptune class Exoplanets,"Summary of article:
As per study, for Jupiter and Neptune class planets, Magnetic field decay occurs because as planets age, they cool down and their luminosities and their convective flux become gradually weaker. Higher atmospheric envelope fractions cause more material available for convection, which yields stronger magnetic fields.

The field strength reduces for extremely irradiated planets because they have lower average density. The surface magnetic field decreases past the threshold value as orbital separation (distance between the exoplanet and its host star) further increases.

The magnetic fields could be observable in the radio wavelengths via auroral emission using ground based observations.

Jupiter-class planets have magnetic fields large enough to generate radiation whose peak frequency exceeds the Earth’s ionospheric cutoff. The same occurs for the Neptune-class planets  if they have  𝑀 &gt; 15 𝑀⊕ and 𝑓env&gt; 4%.

For hot jupiter class planets, atmospheric evaporation does not affect magnetic field generation. For hot Neptunes, atmospheric evaporation leads to greater mass loss and causes less material for convection, so they produce weaker magnetic fields.

productivity,How do you keep track of your creative ideas and to-dos?,"Hey guys,



I’ve been struggling to stay on top of my creative ideas and daily tasks lately. Sometimes I’ll have a random idea pop into my head, or I’ll think of something important I need to do later, but by the time I try to write it down, I’ve already forgotten half of it.



I’ve tried using apps like Notion and Todoist, but I often find myself overwhelmed with organizing everything or too lazy to type things out in the moment. I’m wondering how you all manage to capture ideas and keep track of your to-dos effectively.



Do you have a go-to app, tool, or system that works for you? I’d love to hear your suggestions and how you’ve made it work in your routine!

productivity,My Daily Productivity Stack in 2024,"As someone who juggles between Windows, macOS, and iOS devices daily, cross-platform synchronization is a must for me. Over the past year, I’ve settled into a productivity system that’s both efficient and flexible. 

Here’s what I’m using in 2024:

**Information Collection**

* Google Chrome: A classic that needs no introduction. Its cross-device compatibility and plugin support make it a powerhouse, easily outpacing Safari or Edge. 
* ChatGPT： My go-to for quick insights, brainstorming, and deeper dives into topics. The ""search engine"" for the AI era.

**Information Organization**

* Raindrop.io: Fantastic ""read-it-later"" tool for storing any link-based information. While similar tools like Cubox exist, I find Raindrop's interface and features more appealing. The free version works perfectly for me.
* Eagle: An excellent media management app for storing and organizing images, audio, and videos. It's a lifesaver for creators and designers. Paired with its browser plugin and resource community, Eagle makes finding and managing creative assets seamless.

**Content Creation**

* Mebot: A lightweight tool for quick notes and writing. What sets Mebot apart is its simplicity—focused purely on note-taking and writing without unnecessary bloat. The magic lies in consistently capturing ideas; meaning emerges naturally over time.
* Figma: A game-changer for design work. Switching from Photoshop to Figma has been a revelation—it’s faster, easier to use, and enriched by community tools and resources.

**Database Notes**

* Notion: Notion is my mainstay for managing processed knowledge and tracking projects. With Notion AI, organizing and extracting value from my database has become even more powerful. It’s also indispensable for project tracking and team collaboration.

**Time Tracking**

* Notion Calendar: Previously, I used Cron, but now it’s seamlessly integrated with Notion.  It works flawlessly across devices and ties directly into my existing workflow.

These tools have been instrumental in keeping me organized and productive in 2024. I’d love to know what tools you are using to streamline your workflow. ",Vivid-Affect4738,https://reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1gyocyp/my_daily_productivity_stack_in_2024/,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1gyocyp/my_daily_productivity_stack_in_2024/,2024-11-24 10:50:39,2,0.75,2,0,2,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,Software,self,
productivity,Discipline working from home? Suggestions,"I started a job in May that is fully remote, but I am struggling to stay disciplined and getting enough work done. I got into a bad habit of just working with my laptop on a table on the couch. Finally I forced myself (to be an adult lol) and reorganized my home office, in the basement so away from the tv and couch, got everything set up so it’s easier to see what’s where and cleaned up. The organized environment that is away from my normal personal space seems to have started helping. 

I do have a daily routine that I stick to, especially in the morning. I wake up about 5 AM, make my bed, change out of PJs, have breakfast, start work.

However, the most important struggle I have had is being disciplined. It’s been so easy to distract myself with household tasks, like unloading the dishwasher in the middle of the day.

programming,The State of the Subreddit (May 2024),"Hello fellow programs! 

**tl;dr** some revisions to the rules to reduce low quality blogspam. The most notable are: banning **listicles** (""7 cool things I copy-pasted from somebody else!""), **extreme beginner articles** (""how to use a for loop""), and some **limitations on career posts** (they must be related to programming careers). Lastly, I want **feedback** on these changes and the subreddit in general and invite you to **vote** and **use the report button** when you see posts that violate the rules because they'll help us get to it faster.

r/programming's mission is to **be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day**. [Last time we spoke](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/173viwj/meta_the_future_of_rprogramming/) I introduced the rules that we've been moderating by to accomplish that. Subjectively, quality on the subreddit while not perfect is much improved since then. Since it's still mainly just me moderating it's hard to tell what's objectively bad vs what just annoys me personally, and to do that I've been keeping an eye on a few forms of content to see how they perform (using mostly votes and comment quantity &amp; health).

Based on that the notable changes are:

* 🚫 **Listicles**. ""7 cool python functions"", ""14 ways to get promoted"". These are usually spammy content farms. If you found 15 amazing open source projects that will blow my mind, post those projects instead.
* 🚫 **Extreme beginner content** (""how to write a for loop""). This is difficult to identify objectively (how can you tell it from good articles like ""how does kafka work?"" or ""getting started with linear algebra for ML""?) so there will be some back and forth on calibrating, but there has been a swath of very low quality [""tutorials""](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chogwb/first_program_of_java/) if you can even call them that, that I very much doubt anybody is actually learning anything from and they sit at 0 points. Since ""what is a variable?"" is probably not useful to anybody already reading r/programming this is a quick painless way to boost the average quality on the subreddit.
* ⚠️ **Career posts must be related to software engineering careers**. To be honest I'm personally not a fan of career posts on r/programming at all (but shout out to [cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/)!) but during the last rules revision they were doing pretty well so I know there is an audience for it that I don't want to get in the way of. Since then there has been growth in this category [all across the quality spectrum](https://www.reddit.com/domain/eng-leadership.com/) (with an accompanying rise in product management methodology like ""agile vs waterfall"", also across the quality spectrum). Going forward these posts must be distinctly related to software engineering careers rather than just generic working. This isn't a huge problem yet but I predict that it will be as the percentage of career content is growing.

In all of these cases the category is more of a tell that the quality is probably low, so exceptions will be made where that's not the case. These are difficult categories to moderate by so I'll **probably make some mistakes** on the boundaries and that's okay, let me know and we'll figure it out.

Some other categories that I'm **keeping an eye on** but not ruling on today are:

* **Corporate blogs** simply describing their product in the guise of ""what is an authorisation framework?"" (I'm [looking at you Auth0](https://www.reddit.com/domain/a0.to/) and [others like it](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1cgx739/what_is_ai_infrastructure_software/)). Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it. Companies use their blogs as marketing, branding, and recruiting tools and that's okay when it's ""writing a good article will make people think of us"" but it doesn't go here if it's just a literal advert. Usually they are titled in a way that I don't spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments.
* **Generic AI content** that [isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chll2o/ai_still_hasnt_figured_out_branding_yet_heres_why/) technical in content. ""Does Devin mean that programming is over?"", ""Will AI put farmers out of work?"", ""Is AI art?"". For a few weeks these were the titles of about 20 articles per day, some scoring high and some low. Fashions like this come and go but I'm keeping an eye on it.
* **Newsletters**: There are a [few people](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1cho9ye/big_tech_digest_15_introducing_meta_llama_3_at/) that post every edition of their newsletter to reddit, where that newsletter is really just aggregating content from elsewhere. It's clear that they are trying to grow a monetised audience using reddit, but that's okay if it's providing valuable curation or if the content is good and people like it. So we'll see.
* **Career posts**. Personally I'd like r/programming to be a deeply technical place but as mentioned there's clearly an audience for career advice. That said, the posts that are scoring the highest in this category are mostly people upvoting to agree with a statement in the title, not something that anybody is learning from. (""Don't make your engineers context-switch."" ""Everybody should get private offices."" ""Micromanaging sucks."") The ones that one could actually learn from with an instructive lean mostly don't do well; people seem to not really be interested in how to have the best 1:1s with their managers or how you went from Junior to Senior in 18 hours (though [sometimes they are](https://www.reddit.com/domain/highgrowthengineer.com/)). That tells me that there's some subtlety to why these posts are scoring well and I'm keeping an eye on the category. What I don't want is for ""vote up if you want free snacks"" to push out the good stuff or to be a farm for the other 90% of content that's really just personal brand builders.

I'm sure you're as annoyed as I am about these but they're fuzzy lines and difficult to come up with objective criteria around. As always **I'm looking for feedback** on these and if I'm missing any and any other points regarding the subreddit and moderation so let me know what you think.

------

## The rules!

With all of that, here is the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place.

✅ means that it's currently allowed, 🚫 means that it's not currently allowed, ⚠️ means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early.

* ✅ Actual programming content. They probably have actual code in them. Language or library writeups, papers, technology descriptions. How an allocator works. How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works. How our startup built our Frobnicator. For many years this was the only category of allowed content.
* ✅ Academic CS or programming papers
* ✅ Programming news. ChatGPT can write code. A big new CVE just dropped. Curl 8.01 released now with Coffee over IP support.
* ✅ Programmer career content. How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days. Habits of the best engineering managers. These must be related or specific to programming/software engineering careers in some way
* ✅ Articles/news interesting *to* programmers but not about programming. Work from home is bullshit. Return to office is bullshit. There's a Steam sale on programming games. Terry Davis has died. How to SCRUMM. App Store commissions are going up. How to hire a more diverse development team. Interviewing programmers is broken.
* ⚠️ General technology news. Google buys its last competitor. A self driving car hit a pedestrian. Twitter is collapsing. Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis. Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment. Meta cancels work from home. Gnome dropped a feature I like. How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of, uh, cats, yeah it's definitely just for cats. A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local.
* 🚫 Politics. The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden. Please vote for net neutrality. Big Tech is being sued in Europe for *gestures broadly*. Grace Hopper Conference is now 60% male.
* 🚫 Gossip. Richard Stallman switches to Windows. Elon Musk farted. Linus Torvalds was a poopy-head on a mailing list. The People's Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People. Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form. Stack Overflow sucks now. Stack Overflow is good actually.
* ✅ Demos with code. I wrote a game, here it is on GitHub
* 🚫 Demos without code. I wrote a game, come buy it! Please give me feedback on my startup (totally not an ad nosirree). I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor, here's the pricing page. I made a DALL-E image generator. I made the fifteenth animation of A* this week, here's a GIF.
* 🚫 AskReddit type forum questions. What's your favourite programming language? Tabs or spaces? Does anyone else hate it when.
* 🚫 Support questions. How do I write a web crawler? How do I get into programming? Where's my missing semicolon? Please do this obvious homework problem for me. Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because they'd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see, and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway. In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low.
* 🚫 Surveys and 🚫 Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself.
* 🚫 Meta posts. DAE think r/programming sucks? Why did you remove my post? Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear I'm just asking questions. Except this meta post. This one is okay because I'm a tyrant that the rules don't apply to (I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now).

It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if they're the best discussion going on about the news event.

Python,Simplify Your RabbitMQ Workflow with RabbitMQ Queue Manager,"Hi everyone! 👋

I recently started working on [RabbitMQ Queue Manager](https://github.com/ViktorViskov/rabbit-queue-manager)—a Python-based tool designed to make managing RabbitMQ queues easier and more efficient. The idea came from my experience on projects where queue management often felt overly complicated, and I wanted to create something lightweight yet powerful to streamline the process.

# What My Project Does:

RabbitMQ Queue Manager simplifies the process of interacting with RabbitMQ queues. It lets you:

* **Send messages** to RabbitMQ queues effortlessly.
* **Receive messages** with automatic acknowledgement for smooth processing.
* Handle **connection losses** with automatic reconnections.
* Perform **batch operations** to handle multiple messages at once.
* Inspect **queue sizes** to monitor system health.
* Use a **Pythonic iterable interface** to consume messages naturally.

This tool is ideal for Python developers looking to integrate RabbitMQ into their applications with minimal overhead.

# Call for Feedback and Collaboration:

Right now, the repository is in its early stages, and I’m actively working on improving it. If you’ve been searching for a simple RabbitMQ tool, have suggestions for new features, or would like to contribute, your help would be invaluable! 🙌

Check it out on GitHub: [RabbitMQ Queue Manager](https://github.com/ViktorViskov/rabbit-queue-manager).

Python,"pydantic-resolve, a lightweight library based on pydantic which greatly helps on building data. ","**What My Project Does:**

  
[https://allmonday.github.io/pydantic-resolve/v2/why/](https://allmonday.github.io/pydantic-resolve/v2/why/)  why create a new lib.

pydantic-resolve is a lightweight wrapper library based on pydantic, which can greatly simplify the complexity of building data.

With the help of pydantic, it can describe data structures using graph relationships like GraphQL, and also make adjustments based on business requirements while fetching data.

Using an ER-oriented modeling approach, it can provide you with a 3 to 5 times increase in development efficiency and reduce code volume by more than 50%.

It offers `resolve` and `post` methods for pydantic objects.  (pre and post process)

by providing root data and full schema definitions, Resolve will fill all descendants for you.

    from pydantic_resolve import Resolver
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    
    class Car(BaseModel):
        id: int
        name: str
        produced_by: str
    
    class Child(BaseModel):
        id: int
        name: str
    
        cars: List[Car] = []
        async def resolve_cars(self):
            return await get_cars_by_child(self.id)
    
        description: str = ''
        def post_description(self):
            desc = ', '.join([c.name for c in self.cars])
            return f'{self.name} owns {len(self.cars)} cars, they are: {desc}'
    
    children = await Resolver.resolve([
            Child(id=1, name=""Titan""), 
            Child(id=1, name=""Siri"")]
        )

`resolve` is usually used to fetch data, while `post` can perform additional processing after fetching the data.

After defining the object methods and initializing the objects, pydantic-resolve will internally traverse the data and execute these methods to process the data.

With the help of dataloader, pydantic-resolve can avoid the N+1 query problem that often occurs when fetching data in multiple layers, optimizing performance.

In addition, it also provides `expose` and `collector` mechanisms to facilitate cross-layer data processing.

**Target Audience:**

backend developers who need to compose data from different sources

**Comparison:**

GraphQL, ORM， it provides a more general way (declarative way) to build the data.

GraphQL is flexible but the actual query is not maintained at backend.

ORM relationship is powerful but limited in relational db, not easy to join resource from remote

pydantic-resolve aims to provide a balanced tool between GraphQL and ORM,  it joins resource with dataloader and 100% keep data structure at backend (with almost zero extra cost)

Python,"Just published part 2 of my articles on Python Project Management and Packaging, illustrated with uv","
Hey everyone,

Just finished the second part of my comprehensive guide on Python project management. This part covers both building packages and publishing.

It's like the first article, the goal is to dig in the PEPs and specifications to understand what the standard is, why it came to be and how. This is was mostly covered in the build system section of the article.

The article: https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-concepts-illustrated-with-uv-part-2/

I have tried to implement some of your feedback. I worked a lot on the typos (I believe there aren't any but I may be wrong), and I tried to divide the article into three smaller articles:
- Just the high level overview: https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-part-2-high-level-overview/
- The deeper dive into the PEPs and specs for build systems: https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-part-2-source-trees-and-build-systems-interface/
- The deeper dive into PEPs and specs for package formats: https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-part-2-sdists-and-wheels/
- Editable installs and customizing the build process (+ custom hooks): https://reinforcedknowledge.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-python-project-management-and-packaging-part-ii-editable-installs-custom-hooks-and-more-customization/

In the parent article there are also two smalls sections about `uv build` and `uv publish`. I don't think they deserve to be in a separate smaller article and I included them for completeness but anyone can just go `uv help &lt;command&gt;` and read about the command and it'd be much better. I did explain some small details that I believe that not everyone knows but I don't think it replaces your own reading of the doc for these commands.


In this part I tried to understand two things:

1- How the tooling works, what is the standard for the build backend, what it is for the build frontend, how do they communicate etc. I think it's the most valuable part of this article. There was a lot to cover, the build environment, how the PEP considered escape hatches and how it thought of some use cases like if you needed to override a build requirement etc. That's the part I enjoyed reading about and writing. I think it builds a deep understand of how these tools work and interact with each other, and what you can expect as well.

There are also two toy examples that I enjoyed explaining, the first is about editable installs, how they differ when they're installed in a project's environment from a regular install.

The second is customising the build process by going beyond the standard with custom hooks. A reader asked in a comment on the first part about integrating Pyarmor as part of its build process so I took that to showcase custom hooks with the `hatchling` build backend, and made some parallels with the specification.

2- What are the package formats for Python projects. I think for this part you can just read the high level overview and go read the specifications directly. Besides some subsections like explaining some particular points in extracting the tarball or signing wheels etc., I don't think I'm bringing much here. You'll obviously learn about the contents of these package formats and how they're extracted / installed, but I copy pasted a lot of the specification. The information can be provided directly without paraphrasing or writing a prose about it. When needed, I do explain a little bit, like why installers must replace leading slashes in files when installing a wheel etc.


I hope you can learn something from this. If you don't want to read through the articles don't hesitate to ask a question in the comments or directly here on Reddit. I'll answer when I can and if I can 😅

I still don't think my style of writing is pleasurable or appealing to read but I enjoyed the learning, the understanding, and the writing.

And again, I'l always recommend reading the PEPs and specs yourself, especially the rejected ideas sections, there's a lot of insight to gain from them I believe.

Python,Use python to build mk Converter,"🚀 Check out my URL/PDF/DOCX to Markdown Converter!

Hey fellow developers! 👋

I'm super excited to share a tool I've been working on that I think might make your life a bit easier. You know that annoying process of converting documents to Markdown? Well, I built something to handle that! 

**What does it do?**
- Converts web pages to Markdown with just a URL
- Transforms PDF files to Markdown (using pdfplumber)
- Converts DOCX files to clean Markdown
- Lets you preview the rendered result right there
- Comes with copy/download buttons for quick access

I built it using FastAPI for the backend (it's crazy fast! ⚡) and kept the frontend super clean and simple. You literally just paste a URL or upload a file, hit convert, and boom! 💥 You've got your Markdown.

**Why I made this:**
I got tired of manually converting docs for my documentation work, and thought others might find this useful too. Plus, I wanted to learn more about FastAPI and document processing in Python.

**Tech stack:**
- FastAPI (because who doesn't love async Python? 🐍)
- pdfplumber for PDF parsing
- python-docx for Word docs
- marked.js for the preview
- Basic HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend

The code is open source, and I'd love to get your feedback or contributions! Check out the screenshots in the README to see it in action.

**Try it out:**
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run with uvicorn
4. Convert all the things! 🎉

What do you think? Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvements! And if anyone wants to contribute, PRs are more than welcome! 🤝

Python,Generate Realistic Podcast Sessions Programmatically,"Hey everyone! 👋

I just released `podcast_tts`, a Python library that generates **realistic podcasts and dialogues** with multi-speaker audio, background music, and professional-quality mixing—all running **100% locally**.

# What My Project Does

`podcast_tts` allows you to programmatically create high-quality audio sessions with multiple speakers, dynamic or premade voice profiles, and customizable background music. You can save the output as MP3 or WAV files and even assign playback to specific audio channels for spatial separation.

It’s designed to be flexible, whether you’re building an API with FastAPI or experimenting with personal projects.

# Target Audience

This library is perfect for:

* Developers needing a **local TTS solution** for privacy or offline use.
* Engineers building backend systems for **audio generation** (e.g., podcasts or virtual assistants).
* Anyone looking for an all-in-one tool for **dialogue generation** with professional audio quality.

# Comparison to Alternatives

Unlike many TTS libraries that rely on cloud services, `podcast_tts` is fully offline, ensuring privacy and reducing latency. It also integrates features like **multi-speaker support**, **background music mixing**, and **text normalization**, which are often missing or require multiple tools to achieve.

The project is **open source**, and you can find it on GitHub here: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/puntorigen/podcast_tts).  
It’s also available on **PyPI** for easy installation: `pip install podcast_tts`.

I’ve shared more details in a [blog post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/creating-realistic-podcasts-python-developers-guide-schaffner-bofill-rdgue/?trackingId=KVXkcD61TX6DTgTHZ0Cagw%3D%3D) on LinkedIn and would love to hear your feedback!

* Headless Operation: Scrapes data silently in the background (without opening a visible browser window) — perfect for automated tasks or server environments.
* Flexible &amp; Easy-to-Use: Simple setup, clear method calls, and works seamlessly with Selenium WebDriver.

# Example Usage:

1. Installation: Simply install via pip:

&amp;#8203;

    pip install MetaDataScraper

2) Loginless Scraping (no Facebook login required):

    from MetaDataScraper import LoginlessScraper
    
    page_id = ""your_target_page_id""
    scraper = LoginlessScraper(page_id)
    result = scraper.scrape()
    
    print(f""Followers: {result['followers']}"")
    print(f""Post Texts: {result['post_texts']}"")

3) Logged-In Scraping (for more access):

    from MetaDataScraper import LoggedInScraper
    
    page_id = ""your_target_page_id""
    email = ""your_facebook_email""
    password = ""your_facebook_password""
    scraper = LoggedInScraper(page_id, email, password)
    result = scraper.scrape()
    
    print(f""Followers: {result['followers']}"")
    print(f""Post Likes: {result['post_likes']}"")
    print(f""Video Links: {result['video_links']}"")

# Comparision to existing alternatives

* Ease of Use: Setup is quick and easy — just pass the Facebook page ID and start scraping!
* No Facebook API Required: No need for dealing with Facebook's complex API limits or token issues. This package uses Selenium for direct web scraping, which is much more flexible.
* Better Data Access: With the LoggedInScraper, you can scrape content that might be unavailable to public visitors, all using your own Facebook account credentials.
* Updated Code Logic: With Meta's code updating quite often, many of the now existing scraper packages are defunct. This package is continuously tested and monitored to make sure that the scraper remains functional.

# Target Audience:

* Data Analysts: For tracking page metrics and social media analytics.
* Marketing Professionals: To monitor engagement on Facebook pages and competitor tracking.
* Researchers: Anyone looking to gather Facebook data for research purposes.
* Social Media Enthusiasts: Those interested in scraping Facebook data for personal projects or insights.

# Dependencies:

* Selenium

Python,11 Python Boilerplate Code Snippets Every Developer Needs,"Python's simplicity makes it a favorite among developers, especially in trending fields like AI, machine learning, and automation. But let's face it—repeating boilerplate code can be a drag. That’s where **Python snippets** come in!

From validating emails to shuffling lists, we’ve rounded up 11 essential Python boilerplate snippets to simplify your daily tasks and supercharge your workflow:

# 🔍 1. Validate Email Formats (Regex Simplified)

Use regular expressions to validate email strings efficiently:

    pythonCopy codeimport re  
    def validate_email(email):  
        email_pattern = re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$')  
        return bool(email_pattern.match(email))  
    

# ✂️ 2. Slice Strings &amp; Lists Like a Pro

Access sub-elements directly without loops for cleaner code:

    pythonCopy codemy_string = ""Hello, World!""  
    print(my_string[0:5])  # Output: Hello  
    

# 🔄 3. Compare Words: Are They Anagrams?

Quickly check if two strings are anagrams with `collections.Counter`:

    pythonCopy codefrom collections import Counter  
    def are_anagrams(word1, word2):  
        return Counter(word1) == Counter(word2)  
    

# 🆕 4. Capitalize Words with title()

Effortlessly format strings for clean output:

    pythonCopy codeinput_string = ""hello world""  
    print(input_string.title())  # Output: Hello World  
    

# 🔍 5. Find Differences Between Sets

Identify unique elements between two sets using `difference()`:

    pythonCopy codeset1 = {1, 2, 3}  
    set2 = {3, 4, 5}  
    print(set1.difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2}  
    

And there’s more! From finding the most frequent elements in a list to using `shuffle()` for randomizing data, these snippets save you time and hassle.

Python,Pyrogram: Command modulation like discord.py,"Hi everyone!

I’ve been working with discord.py for a while, and one of the features I really love is the dynamic command loading system (Cogs). It keeps the codebase clean and scalable by organizing commands into separate files/modules.

Now, I’ve started working with Pyrogram, and I find having all the bot’s logic in a single file quite messy. I’m looking for a way to dynamically load commands in main.py from separate files within a commands folder, similar to how Cogs work in Discord.py.

Here’s my current project structure:

```project/
│
├── .venv/
├── secrets/
│   ├── .env
│   └── config.py
├── commands/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── help.py
│   ├── start.py
│   ├── example.py
├── main.py
```

What I’m Looking For:

1. A way to dynamically discover and load all commands from the commands folder into main.py.

2. Ideally, commands should be added to the bot without modifying main.py directly.

Python,Basic Components: Server-Side UI Components for Python Web Apps (Feedback Appreciated),"Hi everyone! 👋

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on called **Basic Components**, which ports shadcn/ui component to the Python/Jinja.

# What My Project Does

**Basic Components** is a collection of reusable, **server-side UI components** built with [JinjaX](https://jinjax.scaletti.dev/), [htmx](https://htmx.org/), and [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a port of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) to Python/Jinja. It allows you to build dynamic, responsive web applications using Python web frameworks like **FastAPI**, **Django**, and **Flask**.

**Key Features**:

* **Copy/Paste Components**: No package to install; simply copy the components you need into your project.
* **Full Customization**: Complete control over the components to modify and extend as needed.
* **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent and rapid UI development.
* **Accessibility-First Design**: Components are built with accessibility in mind, based on shadcn/ui.
* **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in theming with light and dark modes.
* **Markup Compatibility**: The component markup is the same as in shadcn/ui, making it easy to adapt and integrate.

# Target Audience

This project is intended for Python web developers who prefer a server-first architecture and want to build modern, interactive web applications without relying heavily on client-side JavaScript frameworks.

# Comparison to Existing Alternatives

While there are many frontend component libraries available for JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue, Python web development has fewer options for modern, component-based UI development. **Basic Components** differs by:

* **Server-Side Rendering**: Components are rendered on the server using JinjaX, improving performance, SEO, and accessibility.
* **No Additional Dependencies**: Unlike traditional libraries, there's no package to install; you own the code and can customize it freely.
* **Integration with Python Frameworks**: Runs on anything that supports Jinja templates. I've included examples for **FastAPI**, **Django**, and **Flask**.
* **Minimal Client-Side JavaScript**: Uses **htmx** and **Alpine.js** for dynamic behavior without the overhead of heavy frontend frameworks.
* **Markup Parity with shadcn/ui**: Since components are based on shadcn/ui, the markup is the same, making it easy to transition components created for  shadcn/ui with minimal changes.
* **AI**: I've leveraged LLMs to port code from the shadcn/ui React versions to JinjaX, using Alpine.js for client side logic and maintaining all of the Tailwind CSS styles. I've included a [guide](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-components/blob/main/llms.md) for porting components also that you can drop into an LLM chat for context.

# Example Usage

Here's how a component might look in your template:

    &lt;Button
      variant=""outline""
      hx-get=""/api/data""
      hx-target=""#result""
      x-on:click=""open = !open""
    &gt;
      Click me
    &lt;/Button&gt;

* `&lt;Button&gt;`: A server-side component rendered with JinjaX.
* `hx-get` **/** `hx-target`: **htmx** attributes for dynamic server communication.
* `x-on:click`: **Alpine.js** directive for client-side interactivity.
* **Markup Compatibility**: The markup is consistent with shadcn/ui components, allowing for familiarity and ease of use.

# Feedback Welcome

The project is MIT licensed and is a work in progress, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or contributions if you are interested.

Thank you for your time, and I hope you find **Basic Components** useful!

unpopularopinion,Copyright shouldn’t persist 70 years after the creator’s death.,"Now, obviously this becomes more complicated if the work is also owned/managed by a brand or company, so let me clarify: In my opinion, copyright should be null after a creator’s death if they’re the sole creator, sole manager of the work, and doesn’t have someone they want to transfer the rights to. Having to wait 70 years after someone dies to use their work is stupid. Maybe it’s about their family, but I’d wager some family members will still be around in 70 years. Why not then make it, like, 150 where surely no one who knew them would still be kicking? A mourning period of maybe like one or a few years out of general respect to the dead rather than respect to the work is one thing, but 70 years is incredibly excessive. And if it’s about the creator’s wishes of potentially not wanting anyone to continue their work after they die, then it shouldn’t be an option at all. Like, no using an unwilling author’s work after they die, period. What’s 70 years to a dead person? To them, there’s no difference between 2 seconds and 70 years, they’re *dead*. Genuinely, if it’s about the wishes of the deceased, it’s kind of all or nothing here.

The only other reason I can think of as to why this rule exists is so murder doesn’t happen over the rights, but that’s a huge stretch.

EDIT: Don’t know if I’m allowed to make an edit, but I’m getting flooded with comments of “what abt the family!!!” which I agree with, but which was also apart of what I was referencing in “transferring of rights” which could obviously get a little blurry if they died unexpectedly, granted, but generally I stand by it. Two, ppl also brought up murder a lot, so maybe it’s not as crazy as I thought, and investments! So the “10 year” suggestion some ppl had I wholeheartedly agree with; my post isn’t meant to be “no after-death copyright rules” just exactly what the title says as a general statement.

When people say “thank you” instead of “sorry,” it honestly feels like gaslighting. I get that some say it’s meant to sound confident or see things in a positive light, but let’s be real—it’s just pride getting in the way. Why not just say “sorry” and be accountable?

webdev,(How) do you add confidential projects to your portfolio?,"I recently got a freelance project offer which is going to be paying really well (monthly), we're clear on everything so far but I feel like they're gonna ask for my portfolio tomorrow.

However I've written two separate backends for some government applications, which are understandably confidential. I feel like adding those in would almost guarantee me this job but I don't know if I'm allowed to.

Other than these government projects, I have two more confidential projects that I'd rather not put on my resume lol (backend for betting and slots websites, which are illegal in my country)

At the time I didn't read the whole NDA but they told me that I am allowed to tell people that I've done work for the government, but not the specifics of it. Some of my friends (frontend devs of the same project) were allowed to put it in their resume.

You may encounter service disruption because of that, we are working on neutralising the threat, please bear with us.

Second Edit: Script kitties must be proud right now! So yeah someone is sending requests programmatically and is trying to overwhelm the service or perhaps deplete the API credits in minutes just to prove us wrong. This behaviour is beyond understanding. We really want to apologise to anyone who might experience service interruptions. I am the only one with access to the server and I am currently on holiday for a week, we might have to implement authentication once I get back. Sorry again guys

Third Edit: To whoever did this, I will keep this in my heart until judgement day. You are a troll that destroys what others are trying to build. You are a cockroach and if you have one once of courage, come forward and show us that you are the man by not hiding behind your screen. You did cost us some money but not enough to bring this thing to its knees. You are only makng it harder for others, as we now will have to implement auth and rate limiting restrictions. The server is still up, if you are a real hacker then take us down for good, or are you too incompetent for that?

webdev,Looking for Solutions: Building a Dental Clinic Management App (ERP or Otherwise),"I’m planning to build a dental clinic management app with features like patient management, employee tracking, finance, inventory, and more. Initially, I thought of using Laravel and Next.js, but since I’m working solo, starting from scratch feels overwhelming and it will take forever as an already full time software engineer.

I’m now considering using ERP frameworks like Odoo or ERPNext, but I’m open to other solutions as well. My key questions:


1. How easy is it to customize these frameworks for dental-specific needs (e.g., treatment history, appointment reminders)?

2. Are there better tools or platforms to save time while keeping flexibility?

3. Any challenges or advice when integrating third-party tools (e.g., payment gateways, SMS)?

the stack diagram picture showed the addresses 8000, 8004, 8008, 8012, 8016 then jumped to (showing a line of dots a space between 8016 and 9k) 9000. all having the integers stored in them in order: 84, 42, 56, 10, 28, 8004. 

multiple questions asked but one that really threw me off, it simply stated *eval; chat said that 8004 is actually the address 8004 not necessarily a number passed like the others. so it is taking the value held at 8004 which would be 42. 

i wish i could give a picture. but the declaration for *eval was just that. a declaration. int *eval; and then the stack shown

Instilled with a fear of death, try to escape the holy land
Resist the reaper of mankind, bearers the eager of your blood
Bend over, the forbidden lust, go satisfy your gods
 
[instrumental bridge]

[outro]
Now run away and fade into hell
Cry over the bodies on the ground
Obey the violence, grab the scythe 
And drop the blood on the Fenrir’s claws",Miserable-Coffee-924,https://reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h08cls/hey_i_wrote_lyrics_class_was_very_boring_lol_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1h08cls/hey_i_wrote_lyrics_class_was_very_boring_lol_i/,2024-11-26 09:57:20,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,discussion,,
Music,Which is the best music app,"Which music app is best for Indian music 

So I’m using trial mode in Apple Music and I have been thinking to get premium in any of the music apps and I need some clarity on which one to choose. So far my observation 👇🏻

Apple Music 

Pros - Dolby atmos 

Cons
- doesn’t suggest related songs to the one am playing
- old songs doesn’t seem to be there
- search option is worst it doesn’t suggest songs if it’s not the same spelling as in their library

Spotify

Pros
- automatic song suggestions based on a song u play
- above average sound quality 

Cons
- some old songs will not be available 
- No shuffle, can’t fast forward 
- annoying ads . Too much

YouTube music

Pros
- best suggestion songs
- can search any song and it will be available

Cons
- can’t close the app or switch between!!
- Irritate max with ads (one more canva ad I’ll go mad)
- okayish sound quality 

Which to go for, suggest please 

Reposting in general forum coz the specific Indian music form doesn’t have any suggestions!

productivity,I stopped trying to manage my time — and became insanely productive. Here's how.,"This may seem a strange suggestion. Please bear with me. I found, when I made this switch, I could easily fit a day’s worth of work into a couple of hours. How? Here's the epiphany:

I had to **match my task** **to my** **mood**. Yes. Instead of spending all those years trying to manage my *time*, I should've managed my *mood* instead.

Let me explain.

Our moods can be categorized into four basic states— a combination of high energy/low energy. Feeling positive/ feeling negative. Let's break it down.

&gt;**High energy + Feeling positive:** You’re **happy**. This upbeat, energized state is great for routine tasks, or something like content creation. However, you might be too excited for serious creative problem-solving.

&gt;**High energy + Feeling negative:** You’re **stressed**. Restless. This is probably the worst state for creative problem-solving. *(There's a solution we'll discuss shortly.)*

&gt;**Low energy + Feeling negative:** You’re feeling **depressed** and hopeless. It's hard to do anything productive. This is clearly a state to avoid.

&gt;**Low energy + Feeling positive:** You're **relaxed**, optimistic, and you feel good. My favorite state. This is when creative ideas are most likely to emerge. You're able to tackle your biggest, scariest tasks.

Key Point: Recognize your mood, and then pick a task to match.

One caveat: you almost always have a lot of tasks to do, and you *cannot* always depend on your 'mood.' That way you'd get *nothing* done. There's an interesting solution to this: you can pick tasks to **change your mood**.

.

Do you check your phone first thing in the morning? I did too—and it's a BIG mistake. You see, the morning is likely your most creative time of day. You are **relaxed**, and you probably feel **positive**. This is quite literally the best state to get stuff done.

But when you check your phone, it drags you *away* from the relaxed state. It always *raises your energy*. And if you see something unpleasant (an angry email, bad news et al.), it throws you into a negative state as well.

This is what happens next. You go from:

1. Relaxed ➡ High energy
2. Positive ➡ Negative.

In short, you become **stressed**— which isn't a nice place to get work done.

Key Point: Avoid tasks which put you in unfavorable moods.

.

Let's say you do your best work in the **relaxed** state. However, by around noon, your energy levels have picked up. You also have to do tasks you hate, which often make you feel negative. This has sent you into the **stressed** state.

To offset this stress, you can engage in physical activity—exercise, walking, running, swimming, weightlifting, or whatever is an option. This will lower your energy, and make you feel good.

Key Point: Pick tasks which put you in favorable moods.

.

Here’s what you can do depending on each mood:

&gt;**Happy:** Tackle administrative tasks, create content, or brainstorm ideas for problems you're trying to solve.

&gt;**Stressed:** Go for a run. Hit the gym. Engage in any kind of physical activity—it can help reduce stress.

&gt;**Depressed:** If possible, step away from work and engage in activities like watching a movie or taking a walk. Getting outside is a huge help. If you must work, choose tasks that don't require a high level of creativity or emotional energy, such as administrative work or research. If you must do creative tasks, begin with a small, achievable goal like writing a page or two.

&gt;**Relaxed:** Take advantage of this state. Don’t waste it. Stay away from emails and social media. This is the mood which saves you the most time. Solve your most challenging and daunting tasks head-on. The ones you've been putting off.

That's all. What do you think?

unpopularopinion,Is it ok to go away with your friends for your birthday and not bring your partner ? ,"I'm wondering how people see this situation.  We have been together for nearly 3 years now and last year my girlfriend went away with her friends for her 40th birthday.  To be honest I felt a little overshadowed by the situation,  but it was her 40th so I thought it was just for the special occasion.  This year she is doing the same thing again . Her friends are paying for it as a birthday gift , and I'm happy that she has someone to do that for her because I can't afford that . But I can't help but feel a bit depressed because she deserves that but I can't give that to her .It almost feels like she's celebrating without me too . I'm so conflicted,  I don't know how to feel about the situation. Don't get me wrong , I'll never interfere or make her feel bad for going , like I said she really deserves this . I wouldn't feel right celebrating without her by my side but i guess I'm old school like that , not everyone thinks that way . Let me know your thoughts on it .

unpopularopinion,people who film themselves saving animals in danger are awful.,"i'm sick of seeing tiktoks where a person suddenly comes across an injured or trapped animal (usually cat or kitten) and film themselves saving it. 

i might sound like a snowflake rn, but it just feels really disrespectful and fake. there's no reason to pull out your phone and start filming. you could be endangering an animal even more, because of you own selfishness. 

ofc the most important thing is that the animal is saved, but you could just save the animal first, and then take a video to talk about it. i always go into the comments and no one is saying anything about it.

i couldn't imagine a scenario where i would see an animal in pain on afraid, and start filming on my phone.",veekoree,https://reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1h0bo5f/people_who_film_themselves_saving_animals_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1h0bo5f/people_who_film_themselves_saving_animals_in/,2024-11-26 13:18:52,34,0.82,34,0,22,0,0,False,False,True,False,False,,,
